Compare for a data set that goes from 2 to 100 items.  As n grows the NP solution time grows horrifically fast.  P     2\\^5, 10\\^5, 100\\^5 vs  NP  2\\^5, 2\\^10, 2\\^100  All problems that are P are NP in that P is a subset of NP.  Think P = Polynomial time, NP = non deterministic Polynomial time.  One of the aspects of NP problems is you can verify a solution in polynomial time.  If a problem has a polynomial time solution then verifying the solution can be done worst case polynomial time.  For example assume I have an algorithm that finds all the prime numbers from 1 .. n and it has a run time of O(n\\^k).  If the number 534,343,534,343,534,343 is  in the range 1..n I can guarantee to test if it is prime within polynomial time.  Worst case I can just use the algorithm I used to find all the primes which I know is bound by O(n\\^k).  This is why all P problems are a subset of NP problems.

That if we adjust the NewRatio Java opts variable, the process should complete just fine. Seasoned engineers looked at me like I was a genius when my solution worked. Am I a genius? Hell no. I just so happened to write a research paper on Java garbage collection in my last semester of school. Out of the hundreds of things I don't know everyday, I did know this one thing.  When people say that getting into programming requires you to accept that you will spend the rest of your life learning, they aren't joking. If you aren't busy learning what's already out there, you'll be busy learning all the new technology that has yet to come out."

    - text: "I am retired now but got my BS, MS, and PhD in CS at different schools and my career included government, industry, and university professorship. I have even been a general agency-wide recruiter in my career. Computer Science (especially today) could better be named Computing Science. It is the study of computing and computing systems (including artificial intelligence). It includes the architecture and internals of computers, Operating Systems, networks, and the Internet because that gives one extra insight into computing solutions that can be applied elsewhere. A person with a CS degree might have a job writing code to process and summarize data, then analyzing the results to find patterns that lead to further development of software and/or systems that solve some problem or implement some application. A CS person might write code that gets inserted into non-computer hardware that need to be controlled or managed (such as GPS devices, printers, cars, farm equipment, telecom switches, robotic devices, graphics cards in a PC, etc) which we collectively call embedded systems. A CS person might work for a gaming company to develop games, but that may require additional art, graphics, and gaming background. A CS person might be hired to work primarily with databases or information systems (such as with insurance companies). A CS person might work on various parts of a website (front end and/or backend). Ones first job may involve quality assessment, preparing/analyzing data, or making cosmetic changes to a website, but one can look for promotions or movement within to other jobs. If CS is a minor or 2nd major then doors of opportunity can open up in non-tech areas too—at least it may result in getting an interview that the person without any CS doesn’t get. You might be perceived as someone who would be good on the team because you are smart and you have technical expertise. Having CS in the mix might make you more attractive going into medicine, nursing, healthcare, business, pharmaceutical, law, criminal justice,  or social work. A recruiter might simply want to grant an interview to hear your story— seeing strong CS credentials and wondering why an interest in a different industry. Always remember that coding or programming often is people oriented because you are creating something to help or entertain people. It is not computer-centric. A person often invents a computer solution to do something that he/she is bored doing the existing slow, tedious, or uninteresting way. So your CS knowledge will even help you be more effective when making a spreadsheet for some club or non-profit organization you may volunteer with. Bottom line— it can open doors to everything if you have the confidence to step through (or talk your way in)."

    - text: "As the name implies, it creates sub-networks. All of your computers might be on one big physical network but you can logically divide them into smaller sub-networks that can then be firewalled off or whatever makes sense for operational or security reasons. Put important data in a special protected subnet away from your office machines that browse the internet for example. Makes sure computers in one subnet can't talk to ones in another subnet. It keeps things separated.  A mask is what enables you to tell if a specific computer is on a specific subnet. Computers are identified on the network by IP address (ok technically a MAC address too but let's focus on the IP layer which is where subnetting comes in). Often you see an IP address written as something like 192.168.42.1. but that's the human friendly decimal representation: the \"real\" IP address is in binary, sequence of 1s and 0s. In IPv4 (still the dominant network protocol I think but IPv6 is growing) the IP address is 32 bits so that means 32 1s and 0s are used to give a computer a unique \"name\". Usually the 32 bits are split into 4 8-bit groups called \"octets\" that are when written in decimal. That's why you see 192.168.42.1, each number between dots represents 8 bits so all together is 32 bits.  So how do you make a subnet? Well it makes sense to group IP addresses together based on some of the 1s and 0s being in common. Sort of like having a family name, you and family members like share the same family name but have a different person name (John Doe, Jane Doe are both in the Doe family but have different first names to tell them apart on paper).  So your subnet is kind of like a family name, all the computers on that subnet share the same \"name\" which in the case of binary means they share the same sequence of 0s and 1s at the beginning of their name.  The mask is therefore the thing that tells you which of the 32 bits is the \"family\" name (subnet, like Doe) and which are the first name (computer name on network, like John). The way it does this is that you write out all 32 bits of the IP but you put a 1 in every spot where that bit is part of the family subnet name and a 0 where that bit is part of the computer name. 32 is a lot to type out so let's use an example of an 8 bit IP address. If the first 5 bits are the family subnet name, then the last 3 bits must be the computer name. So the subnet mask is 5 1s representing the subnet + 3 0s representing the computer name = 11111000. If you wrote the binary into decimal, you'd get 248 so you might see the subnet mask written as 248... To make it a little more human readable but really it's the bits that are important.  It's become a lot more common to use CIDR notation instead or writing masks. CIDR is just writing the number of bits that are used for the subnet name, so in our example above of an 8 bit IP address with a 5 bit subnet name, then you'd write the subnet mask in CIDR as just /5. Slash, with number of bits, and you're done.  You could have /8, or /16 or /24 or /27 or whatever you want as a subnet mask. What's the difference between them? Well the bigger the subnet number, the more bits are used for the subnet, which means you can lots more unique subnet names. But there's less bits for unique computer names so you can have less computers on that network. So you need to pick a good subnet mask that allows you to have enough networks to do what you need while allowing enough bits for computer names to accommodate the number of computers that need to be on that subnet. It can be tough to estimate that especially in a rapidly growing company so that takes some thought and experience to get right.  Hope that helps!"

In a digital computer, each electrical charge retains exactly 1 bit of information. More precisely, each location where a charge may or may not be, retains 1 bit. It takes many bits together to retain a \"large chunk of information.\"  When the same computer runs two different programs (at different times), the hardware is \"exactly the same\". The difference is which wires, or registers, are \"on\" or \"off\" (contain a charge or not). Software describes this aspect of reality -- the state of the bits. Hardware describes how the bits are wired together, and doesn't typically change during program execution."

That doesn't mean it doesn't come with some disappointments, but it opens a wide range of opportunities, one can argue limitless.  I got a BS, then a MS and the university I went to focused their MS on pursuing a PhD....so a good deal of theory.  One can argue that doesn't translate into the real-world, and perhaps not directly, but it leaves you with an appreciation of the 'science' in Computer Science.  CS is more than just programming, it's foundation is in the academic pursuit of algorithms and logic, the purity of mathematics.  I left with an appreciation those that pursue 'pure mathematics' in the same way theoretical physics pursues a unified theory.  I'll never participate in either, but I have an appreciation of those that do.  University 'can' focus on the love of learning and I found it helpful to view some coursework in that manner.  I've not used Calculus since leaving college, but I still have an appreciation of understanding it (some time ago).  To this day I still wish I didn't have to take 'generals' and I don't feel they contributed to my professional or personal development, but /shrug/ price of admission for any degree.  I feel I left with a solid foundation for the profession, although I wish I had a deeper understanding of threading and distributed systems, but acquired that during the course of my career.

To be sure that your RSA can't be cracked in the next years (not forever) by supercomputers you should use at least 1024 bits per prime, but if you can, 2048 better.  If you want to design purposely a system than can be cracked nor in seconds but also not in hours, it is very hard to determine. Because of the nature of RSA cracking 1 more bit doubles the average time, meaning that de difference between 20 bits and 30 bits is 1000 times longer. For example, if 10 bits takes a minute, 20 bits will take 16 hours so fine-tuning so that it takes the amount of time you want even if it is not that specific, it is still hard.  The time will depend a lot on how fast is you cpu, what environment you are using and if you are using multiple threads. My guess is that you won't be able to do more than 20 bit RSA cracking with a normal computer in less than 30 minutes, but again it highly depends.  You should just try it out, but don't set the bits on the upper bound and star lowering them, rather set the number of bits to 10 and increase them until you are satisfied with the time that it takes."

Thus, your version was slower.  99.999% of the times, you don’t want to try to optimize these kind of basic math. That 0.001% are the times when 1) you are really good at low level programming, 2) you really need to squeeze that performance, and 3) there are constraints on the inputs that the compiler doesn’t know about, so it cannot generate the optimal code.

For example in college you might learn how to code in Java and how the language works, but in Uni they will teach you that as well as classes like data structures and algorithms which teach how to use efficient algorithms for certain tasks in programming. If you are just wanting to learn how to code college is a good start, but if you want to take more in depth courses Uni would be the place to go. Hope this helps."

I had a not fairly large python 2 code before and tried to run in python 3 and it was a mess. Most of the errors that python 3 can only found was \"print\" being in a wrong syntax and that was easy to fix. However, there are other details that changed as well specially on the differences on how Python 2 and Python 3 interprets a particular statement and you have to go and review the whole code where it went wrong.  I find C# on the other hand easier to migrate on code level because of it being a compiled language. Not much is going to change on the syntax. However if there are deprecated codes, it is easy to find because the compiler will find them for you and it saves a lot of time."

Think of Uber, sure it's an app but its implication is a lot further reaching than just being an app.  25 years ago you could say \"Man, I wish that we could all drive each other around, instead of paying money to the Taxi companies.\" There was no system for that, period.   Then, over time, a bunch of technologies came along that made Uber possible. You've got GPS, mapping, wireless payments, online databases, programs that run on phones (which are powerful  computers but fit in your hand, screen and all!).  Those technologies, working together, cohesively made that concept possible.  Here's another example, KhanAcademy:  [https://www.khanacademy.org/](https://www.khanacademy.org/)   Here's a guy (Salman Khan) who believed that people should have access to a quality education anywhere in the world, for free. So, in the form of streaming video, and the web itself, you can go and learn a variety of topics, in depth, for free. I used his classes to supplement my own college courses for years. I'd watch his lessons on a certain topic when I couldn't understand that same topic from my own professors.   You can do so many things in the field of CS (or the sub fields like programming) that its hard to imagine things you CAN'T do."

Trying to prove it right or wrong is impossible because we have no way of testing wether it’s true or false (unless a weird glitch in the matrix shows up).

Which approach to consider for dot product (i.e. multiplying magnitudes of each by cosine of angle between, or multiplying each corresponding element of vectors a and b, then summing) -depending on the size of the device I imagine it would be easier to disregard angles and focus on elements of each vector.  3.

This way it doesn't have to load the kernel, drivers and then start various services on the next boot, as that would involve extra work and checks .  When you boot, it can just copy the contents of the hibernation image right back to RAM, and most drivers and services will barely notice that there was a shutdown. This has a drawback however, as almost everything has to be the same as it was, including the state of the disk. When you are running Windows and a file is open for writing by a driver/service, there is no way in hell that a user (or even administrator) could touch that file. Or just system files in general. But while you're on Linux, you can freely poke in them as Windows isn't there to enforce its rules. Allowing you to mess with the contents of the NTFS drive like that would allow you to ruin a consistency and continuity everything is relying on, easily leading to blue screens of death when a driver or service finds something unexpected.

Specialized software and personalized input devices can improve access, but often provide only limited functionality. In this study, three research participants with tetraplegia who had multielectrode arrays implanted in motor cortex as part of the BrainGate2 clinical trial used an intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) to control an unmodified commercial tablet computer. Neural activity was decoded in real time as a point-and-click wireless Bluetooth mouse, allowing participants to use common and recreational applications (web browsing, email, chatting, playing music on a piano application, sending text messages, etc.). Two of the participants also used the iBCI to “chat” with each other in real time. This study demonstrates, for the first time, high-performance iBCI control of an unmodified, commercially available, general-purpose mobile computing device by people with tetraplegia.

Thanks to the recent availability of data on references among movies, some researchers have started to use citations patterns as an alternative method for ranking movies. In this paper, we propose a novel ranking method for films based on the network of references among movies, calculated by combining four well known centrality indexes: in-degree, closeness, harmonic and PageRank. Our objective is to measure the success of a movie by accounting how much it has influenced other movies produced after its release, from both the artistic and the economic point of view. We apply our method on a subset of the IMDb (Internet Movie Database) citation network consisting of around 47,000 international movies, and we derive a list of films that can be considered milestones in the history of cinema. For each movie we also collect data on its year of release, genres and countries of production, to analyze trends and patterns in the film industry according to such features. We also collect data on 20,000 directors and almost 400,000 performers (actors and actresses), and we use the network of references and our score of movies for evaluating their career, and for ranking them. Since the IMDb dataset we employ is highly biased toward European and North American movies and personalities, our findings can be considered relevant principally for Western culture.

As something becomes more disordered,  the number of bits of information needed to describe it increases – “information grows”.   To find structure we need to throw away information. A common simple example is  summarising a large number of observations in a sample with a single number, by  calculating the sample mean. The reason we calculate the sample mean is  fundamentally that the entropy of the mean is lower than the total entropy of the  original set of  observations.  Throwing away information (aka entropy) is what living  things need to do both to preserve their own biological structure and also as part of  trying to discern structure in their overly information-rich environment.  Its true that there is something that is hard to grow and preserve against the tendency  to increasing disorder, but wouldn't it be better to find a different name for it  than “information” ? That term is already commonly used to quantify something quite  different - the relatively disorderly raw material from which order is excavated."

If incoming energy is absorbed by the circuit, that represents a \"0\" in the computer's binary code, and if the chip reflects the energy, that represents a \"1.\" The switch mechanism uses very little power and enables the fast transfer of information between a wearable device and another kind of technology capable of receiving the data. The researchers say they were challenged by the fact that the chip in the wearable device needs to differentiate between the real Wi-Fi signal and the reflection from the background. They solved this problem by developing a wireless silicon chip that constantly senses and suppresses a background reflection, enabling the Wi-Fi signal to be transmitted without interference from surrounding objects."

It will always depend on whats  the application of your server, how the data/task are distributed amongs the server and what's the consensus protocol level.  But I can already tell you that distributed is mainly used by the majority of big compagnie (Oracle, Google ect) because it is definitely more efficient and it scales a lot better with huge data.  There are multiple reasons distributed is the viable solution: - you can distribute the data around strategic location, so if the main server is in USA but one of the yt video is viral in France, it would be a lot better to keep it on a European server. - having everything on one server forces is not viable when you have million of user, the network on the server side will quickly become a bottleneck. Having multiples server allows to split the connections on different location and not surcharge a the server bandwidth. - if the task is heavy and can be parallelized you can multiply the processing speed by the number of servers you have (kind of). This can work for huge database, example if you search for all people named \"Bob\". Server 1 could search for Bob on the first half of the data and server 2 on the second half.  This is over simplified and in practice distributed servers is way more complicated and behave way differently for every application, but I hope I was clear enough and that I didn't say anything wrong."

You should start with some HTML, do the basic layout, page structure, all that good stuff. While you're doing that, you'll realize you need to add css to accomplish some of what you envisioned for that layout (centering stuff, for example), and you'll be switching between the 2. After that, once you start adding some JavaScript, you'll want to go back and change some stuff in the core layout, so you'll go back alternating HTML/CSS.

I’ve implemented a 2D finite difference explicit heat flow simulation just using array slicing in less than 100 lines of code. Practically useless, but the REPL of Python is very useful for debugging these types of things. And if you need more speed, you can get C or FORTRAN like performance using numba.

Storage is managed by the operating system. Memory management in modern systems is done by the operating system.  Even the compiled formats themselves differ - ELF on Linux, PE/COFF on Windows, Mach-O on MacOS, and a host of other formats that are either historical or simply used by uncommon platforms.  The typical approach to all this is to build for each platform the scaffolding required to run programs. This means you'll generate a Windows build, a Linux build, a MacOS build, and builds for any other platforms you want to target.  For interpreted (or interpretable) languages like Python, that will also mean that you can create operating system-specific builds of the interpreter. 'apt install python3' will install a different binary from 'brew install python', or from 'choco install python'. This does, however, mean that the different python runtimes can execute the same python scripts.  Another approach would be to throw out the operating system altogether. There are two approaches to this - the first is to bundle your application with a stripped-down operating system. There are a number of projects out there to help you build these, but you do need to put in more thought than just choosing a target platform. You can read up on Unikernels to follow this path deeper. Note that supporting actual hardware with this approach can be painful.  The second approach is even more minimal - to write your application to directly drive the hardware. That is, your application doesn't just add AX to BX (though it does to that at some point), you are actually controlling physical hardware states directly from your own code. If your goal is to run everywhere, though, you're likely to die of old age before you finish handling all of the hardware your program will see, so I can't really recommend this approach.  So yes in that it is theoretically possible to target the x86 hardware directly, no in that it is generally not a feasible option."

Just like any language there is an R way of solving problems and once you get the feel for that you’ll write better code but you really ought to understand a lot of concepts about the language to effectively use it. For starters one should learn about all the base objects used in the language and the three most common OOP systems in R (S3,S4 and R5). Then you might want to choose a data structure library you like and learn how that community uses those tools. One of the most popular library collections is the tidyverse. After that learning some functional programming concepts would be helpful and naturally that requires understanding R environments. If you’ve mastered those things you can use R to do a lot.   I know quite a few PhD statisticians (R is more statistics leaning btw) that don’t make any of their own objects and seem to use a small subset of what R is capable of. However, they often have sprawling code bases that are hard to manage and they rewrite the same code a lot.  edit: added names of 3 popular oop systems"

For the most part the field has moved away from that terminology but some textbooks still do it the old way (such as your textbook) .  Note that even if some text were to use the word recursive in both meanings, one should be able to understand which is meant by understanding what type of things they're talking about: the meaning where recursive=computable is a property of (some) mathematical functions, whereas the latter sense of recursive is a property of code/algorithms (which might implement a given mathematical function). Thus for example addition of integers and the factorial  are recursive functions in the sense that they are computable, and some particular implementation of one of them might or might not be recursive in the sense that it calls itself. So as long as you can figure out whether the text is talking about a mathematical function or of some code implementing one, you'll know what recursive means in that context."

Very, very high level view: when you start with C, the clang front end is converting this to LLVM IR. The LLVM IR is then transformed, optimized, and lowered in the middle end. Finally, a back end converts the LLVM IR to machine code. This canonical 3-stage compiler is super nice because it lets you abstract away shared infrastructure (if you build a new CPU instruction set architecture, e.g., RISC-V, you only need a new backend; if you develop a new programming language you only need a new front end) and it lets users hack on the compilation process by writing new transforms that get injected into the middle end.

Along with this, remember that all of programming is made by people as opposed to physics that is dictated by nature. Not every concept will have a nice meaning and you'll encounter things that don't make sense until you see them enough.  A little more practical, pick a language that is forgiving to begin with. You can adapt almost all code into any language, but some are nicer than others. These are organized from high to low level. The lowest is machine code. 1's and 0's whose meaning is dictated by the instruction set. And the highest level is something like html or java. I recommend starting at high-level and going down.

The programs themselves never see or even know any address translation is occurring.   However, for some hardware - like certain microprocessors commonly used as Arduino targets without any significant OS that performs such memory address translations - the addresses a program references are exactly the same as the physical address.

The \"insertion\" operation*cost* into the dynamic array, when the current array size (x) is a power of 2 would be x+1. In other situations it would be merely just 1 operation, as we need to just insert an element at the end of the array (this array has space).   Now according to the method, we need to find the average number of operations that is required for inserting \"x\" number of elements.   The method is straight forward.  x th insertion     1  |   2   |   3    | 4 |  5   | 6 | 7 | 8 |  9   |                 Number              1 | 1+1 | 2+1 | 1 | 4+1| 1 | 1 | 1 | 8+1| Of operations   So total number of operations for x insertions would be 1 + (1+1)+ (2+1) + 1 + (4 +1)+ 1 + 1+ 1+(8+1)+1... i.e. x + (2^0 + 2^1 +  2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 +...2^k)  Where k = floor (logx base2)  i.e. x + 2^(k+1) -1       ( sum of gp series) i.e. x + 2*2^k -1 i.e. x + 2x -1 i.e. 3x -1   This is total number of operations needed for x insertions. For average number of instructions, it is (3x-1)/x ~ 3x/x = 3.  So on an average 3 instructions for insertion operation. According to big oh notation, it is just constant i.e. O(1).  The mistake you are doing is, you are applying big oh notation while calculating the number of operations itself, which is wrong. Big-oh notation is for the order of growth of functions.   So calculate the average number of operations and see how many steps (operations) it requires. Those average number of steps will be in terms of your input x. This itself is your function. You can't just apply big-oh where and when as you like it."

Call Sub(X, Y)  We call the function `Sub` with two arguments, specifically the `X` and `Y` we just declared and initialized.      Subprogram Sub(Integer Num1, Integer Num2 as Reference)  We are now in the function call `Sub` with the two arguments. Now, in the definition of this function, we pass the first argument by value and the second argument as a reference. This means `Num1` in the function is a *copy* of the first argument, whereas `Num2` is a *reference* to the second argument. What this means is that whatever value is initialized to `Num2` will also change the value of `Y`, which we passed in. In contrast. any change to `Num1` will *not* have any affect on `X`, the first argument we passed in.      Declare X as Integer     Set Num1 = 3     Set Num2 = 4  We declare a local variable `X` also of type Integer. We set `Num1` to 3 and `Num2` to 4. Remember that `Num2` is a *reference* to the argument passed in, `Y`. Thus, `Y` from the `Main` function is now initialized to 4. `Num1`, on the other hand, is just a copy of `X` from the `Main` function, so it can be thought of as a local variable.          Set X = 5         Write X     End Subprogram  We set the local variable we declared earlier in the `Sub` function to 5 and write it to the console. We then exist the function and return to `Main`.          Write X         Write Y     End Program  Remember that Y *now* has a value of 4, since we passed it in as a reference to `Sub` and initialized it to 4. Now, We initialized `X` earlier in the main function to be 5 so we write 1 to the console and since Y is now equal to 4, `Write Y` now prints 4 to the console. That is how the output is 5 and 14.

From what I understand, you split b into its powers of two, and then compute the product of a raised to those powers, taking the mod whenever possible to avoid integer overflow.  For example, take a = 10 and b = 29. You can split 10^(29) into 10^((1\\*1 + 0\\*2 + 1\\*4 + 1\\*8 + 1\\*16)) = 10^(1) \\* 10^(4) \\* 10^(8) \\* 10^(16), and keep a running variable that keeps track of the current element to be multiplied, making sure to take the mod of it whenever it is updated. Since only log b elements are being multiplied together, this algorithm is O(log b).

I've always loved CS and I often say I have no regrets, but that's a bit of an overstatement.

Hopefully some of this is useful for you.  1. Practice leetcode or other algorithm / data structure challenges. These are the types of questions that many companies ask during interviews, maybe tying in an application of the type of work they do (e.g. Amazon might ask a question about programming a shipping algorithm).Additionally, build software! If you want to become a web developer, build a website that does something interesting. If you can't think of any ideas, just make a clone of a website that you use, or of something you find cool. You can put these projects on your resume and use them to job search with. Post them on github so employers can see them. 2. Experience is probably all that matters. If you show you can build a piece of software competently with your projects, employers will be attracted. Certifications don't hurt, though. 3. Calculus is used in some applications of computer science, but you likely won't see it in your day to day work unless you have a specialized job that requires it. Most schools require it for CS because it is useful to understand in some cases. Definitely not a requirement, and I know many successful developers who dropped out of high school having never taken any advanced math. 4. When you feel confident with it. Putting something on your resume is giving the interviewer permission to ask you about it. If you don't feel confident being asked questions about it, don't put it on your resume. 5. Web development is hot right now. If this is what you want to do (which I assume you do since you're asking about HTML), then I think you're headed in the right direction. I would add into the mix CSS (and more advanced SCSS), & javascript. After learning about these topics, you could move into learning about a popular web framework like React, Vue, or NextJS. These are a few of the technologies employers are looking for right now. If you're more interested in backend systems, servers, or anything that isn't web related, you might find C (or C++), Go, & Java more interesting. 6. Since you are a public safety officer, maybe you could try looking into some companies that are related. Having the experience you do, I think of companies like Axon that might be particularly interested in hiring you. They could appreciate insight from someone who's been in the shoes of the person using their product. 7. Don't be scared off by a job listing's \"required skills\". Most of the time you might not know 50%+ of what is on the list, but they still might be interested in hiring you. It is rare you will find a job listing and be able to check all the boxes. Apply anyways! 8. Consider taking an internship first. They won't expect you to know much, but it is a great way to get your foot in the door. Showing you are interested and passionate about technology in the interview can get you the opportunity.   I'm always open to giving advice / guidance to beginners in the field.

If you want to learn coding and problem solving in general:    Start by using Python to get a feel for coding. Its a great beginner language because  * Easy, readable syntax * Built-in BigInt support * Dynamic Memory Allocation * Extensive Libraries   Almost every function you are gonna use has been implemented, so you can focus on using them rather than trying to implement them.  After you feel comfortable coding, move on to a more restrictive language, like Java. BigInt and Dynamic Memory Allocation don't come by default, so you have to do some calculations beforehand in terms of memory usage (or just use the library functions).   By this point you will have enough experience to know what to do next.   ^(After that move onto C, and learn about pointers. C is even more restrictive than Java because it also doesn't have BigInt or Dynamic Memory Allocation, but on top of that, no Bounds Checking or Garbage Collection.)  ^^^Finally ^^^move ^^^onto ^^^Brainfuck ^^^to ^^^push ^^^yourself ^^^to ^^^insanity, ^^^and ^^^beyond ^^^/s"

You should go down that path, exploring new sub-fields of CS, until you find something you genuinely like. Forcing yourself through CS, or pretty much anything in life, is almost never the way to go. No amount of advice can instill artificial passion in someone, but I think your problem is not that CS isn't interested, but that that you haven't explored enough yet to find something worthy of interest.  I just graduated but I was also in your shoes as a first-gen student, and especially in a field like CS, I understand how daunting it initially seems to have no background, no head start, or any help to rely on from parents or relatives. I too chose CS half on a whim, and realized the skill disparity compared to my peers early on in college. However, you should use the clever people around you as a goal. Most of my freshman year I only studied CS for the sake of completing assignments or exams, and I sucked at nearly everything. But somewhere down the line, seeing how advanced my friends and classmates were motivated me to reach or exceed their level, and it comes as no surprise that a good friend group + environment is key. Clubs, hackathons, and advanced classes are good ways to go about obtaining both.  I got into competitive programming because one of my first uni friends was on the programming team and introduced me to it. I later got into computer vision research because one of my other friends was into machine learning (and while his specific field wasn't of much interest to me, it helped me eventually stumble across CV and other applications of ML, which I found I loved). To this day I continue to engage in both, inside and outside of school and work.  What's important to understand is that rarely will any school's curriculum walk you through everything, so much of what your classmates know (as you correctly realize) comes from what they've done on their own time. There's an abundance of resources and platforms (i.e. Coursera, Udacity, most interview prep sites, etc.) online at varying levels of expertise that cover various topics in CS, so you can go from knowing little to near-expert independently. It's okay to be behind (everyone starts somewhere), but there's no excuse for *staying* behind.   That being said, if you aren't motivated by your classmates but still want to find something you love, many undergrad catalogs contain paths of study that are more specialized (cybersecurity, robotics, etc.) later in the curriculum (generally taken in the 3rd-4th year). Many of these coincidentally also take you from theory to something tangible, which is probably what you want. So dip your toes into all such paths, either on your own time or in your final year. If not motivated by personal interest, perhaps courses themselves will guide you to something you like. A lot of the process of finding things you like is based on luck and just putting yourself out there into unexplored territory. Who knows, CS might not even be what you actually want to do, but you won't know that until you've tried all of it.  As for the rest (like Github or LinkedIn), those usually just come along the way. Sure, you can showcase projects on Github, but first and foremost it (along with git) is a tool for collaboration and version control, and you should use it as such. Git can be learned from its own guide or a plethora of online resources, and you'll only get familiar with it by using it. Networking on LinkedIn is important and a huge benefit, which should be taken advantage of in college, and while it isn't necessarily the be all and end all of *landing* a job, it can surely help you *find* some.  **TL;DR**: put yourself out there by exploring things on campus or online, find like-minded people to bounce interests off of, and attend relevant events where you're outside of your comfort zone. Everything else will likely come along the way naturally.  Feel free to ask away if you have any other questions."

Anyone can write code but an engineer will do it without introducing breaking changes.  This means focus on a way/process of introducing changes/features that doesn’t break things. If it’s a new feature you’re introducing so you can switch some existing functionality to make use of it, don’t start integrating straight away. Build the new feature in isolation whilst the old method remains in tact. When your new feature is ready (tests exist for the code and pass) you can then write a test that makes some assertion about how the new functionality should return results once integrated. It will fail. You can then update the code to make the test pass. At no point did the code break in between. Finally you can now remove any redundant/dead code to complete the job.  Most developers will just start hacking away at the new feature, updating the code in place, hitting road block after road block. Then because they’ve broken the system, they stress and stress that they’re doing a bad job, which isn’t necessarily the case.   Very few developers I’ve worked with got it right early on, myself included.  If you can prioritise which bits of the system to change first so that you don’t introduce breaking changes, programming becomes a far more logical process rather than a headache."

You can find there examples of the implementation of different ML algorithms with using python's libraries but also theoretical introduction what is the key in my opinion.

You will use accounting, statistics, potentially linear algebra. In an engineering career you may use all sorts of advanced math (calculus, differential equations, and beyond). You may get into circuit design, microprocessor design, DSP, firmware. So imagine what sort of work you see yourself doing. Guiding missiles, building bridges, image processing, robotics, factory control automation? Then an engineering track is for you. If instead, you imagine yourself writing banking or accounting software, business operations, etc. Look at a business track. You will use math for sure. So far you have not had a reason to apply what you know toward a solution. When you enter the work force you will be applying math to answer real questions and earn a living. By applying what you have learned, you will also learn more about how it works and why we use it."

HackerX is a company built around setting those up.  If you aren't in a major tech center (SF Bay Area, Seattle, LA, Austin), it might be more difficult to find one of these.  They are an excellent place to network if you don't have a network and I've always been impressed by something when I've gone to these just to check them out.  Be humble, be confident.  Have an idea of what kind of software you want to write, be it frontend, backend, or full stack, or maybe something completely different like devops or infrastructure, or maybe you want to focus on ML and data science.  They want all of that.  This will of course be difficult in the current hiring environment where companies have cut back on headcount, startups are struggling to find funding, etc.  You might want to consider looking at positions in state government IT departments as a hold-over if you can't get a foot in the door elsewhere.  Your background, believe it or not, actually makes you a more interesting candidate.  Focus on your leetcode problems, your algorithms and data structures, and I have no doubt you'll be able to ace the technical interviews.  To really come across as a winner, I would recommend looking up the leadership principles for large tech companies like FB, Apple, Amazon.  It's not enough to show technical brilliance in interviews at those companies; they want to see that you have a solid sense of direction and correctness of attitude towards the work that fits in with the company culture.  Expressing a growth mindset in the interview helps a lot and will take you very far.  My recommendation would be Amazon, specifically the AWS org.  They hire a lot of people directly out of college, at any age, and while it might not pay the best and you might have to relocate (although in this environment and with amazon's worldwide presence, it might not be to Seattle), it's a fantastic way to start your career even if you only stay for 2 years."

You will have to use a content host too (S3, DigitalOcean spaces, etc)  All of this alone is going to take a lot of time but the good thing is that you can verify your product market fit while building this. Get continuous feedback from your users and build what they want rather than building something really complex and realising no one wants to use it.

When picking out a profession it is important to have an interest for the topic itself, regardless of whether you are managing people or not. If IT is something you're interested in, start learning and building stuff now. You don't need a company to do IT.   IT Manager is not a professional field in itself, it is a job that more experienced IT professionals who happen to have a desire to coordinate other professionals tend to take on.  In IT you typically have two directions to go after being in an entry level role for a few years. You can double-down on technical expertise and become a 'tech lead'/'subject matter expert'/'senior engineer' or go down the management route.  If the people-skills aspect of being a manager is what appeals to you, consider exploring professions that allow you to lean into that passion, like HR, training, or social work.  If you you are interested in getting started with IT, a computer will be important. Contrary to what other people might say, at your age I do not think you should focus on a checklist of things you should learn. Learning that way will get boring and tire you out. What you need to do is get excited. Think about something you want to build: a website, a game, a blog. Start googling (e.g. how to make a simple website). Soon enough you will branch out organically into the different parts of IT. At this stage in your education, having fun and getting obsessed with trying to make an idea come to life is more powerful that any textbook. If you bump into a problem that needs math to solve, you can learn the math then (ask your math teacher to help you!). Learning math with the hope that it will somewhere down the line help with IT (but not know exactly how it will help) is a very demotivating way to learn."

For example the creators of sonic pi, a platform that allows people to play a computer as if it is an instrument spent years building out a language and framework to make this possible.  To make sonic pi run as good as it can it takes a lot of grit, however, thousands of lines of optimizations builds something beautiful — a platform that connects people, music, and computers .  I think the flexibility in CS is that because so much of the world is being changed by computers you can go and change it yourself after working in industry and optimizing other peoples projects and visions.  You should def consider majoring in it."

Python is a good language to start with if you don’t already have a language of choice.   Here’s just a simple project idea: Write a Python script to tell you how many days until your birthday. Expand it to include the birthdays of your family/friends. If within two weeks of one of their birthdays - have it tell you to get them a card/wish them happy birthday on <date of their birth>.  Usually playing around with some simple projects is the best way to pick up on the concepts. Just dig in and enjoy the process."

You’ll also need to know to code (obviously) as well as all the details of a test framework and it would also be helpful to know something like Jenkins. Now, the difference is data structures & algorithms aren’t as important in your job. At this point you’re basically validating that answers are correct so the high-performance algorithms are already taken care of by the backend engineers. So if you’re more interested in developing new features for the end users or applying your knowledge of DS&A you’ll probably be bored in test automation. That being said, not everybody cares about those so for some people it’s a good fit"

While programming was a key aspect, the focus during my academic years was not only the history of computing, and the many different architectures of computing devices, but also computational / mathematical theory. The science part covered implementation and experimentation for transforming those theories into physical existence. (Note that this last part doesn't necessarily require electronics. Indeed, refer to the classic Babbage machine era.)  For me, CS has always been the study of how computers work than how to program them. When I graduated, I was hoping to get into the field of designing and build *new* computer technologies. However, in my 30+ year career, I've typically held jobs nominally titled *Software Engineer*. <sigh>"

[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4103/p531.jpg](https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4103/p531.jpg)  Air is too elastic to flow in that fashion, the high pressure areas mix into the low and diffuse and even out, whereas in a liquid the lack of compression-diffusion elasticity causes the turbulance to stay constant as it does in this video.  Perhaps it was developed on top of a fluid library and it lacks the graphics to illustrate elasticity of air.

The electrical components were simply assembled from off-the-shelf items, the mechanical components are rudimentary and sloppily made, and they have to hand-tailor the instructions for each song - so nothing apparently abstract or elegant in the software side of things either it seems. If it's a simple hand-off between the computer and system controller, then at least it's somewhat cool.

In that case it's exactly the same principle as a normal turbine, the energy extracted is superior to the energy necessary to keep it at the car speed.  http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind-powered_vehicle"

TL;DW: 50% solar and 50% wind, you can be just about 100% renewable with overcapacity of 120% and 12 hours of battery storage. You still have the issue of localization and extended outages (no solar for longer periods in winter, and there could be times of low wind that overlap). I think this could be solved in most places with on-site battery backups (especially for homes) that would provide 48 hours of local backup in addition to grid-level storage. On average, this would require 60kwh of storage per home for 48 hours of complete off-grid backup. With battery prices falling below $100/kwh soon, at scale, this might cost $8000 per home, or $27 per month amortized over a 25 year term. These local batteries could either be owned by the homeowner, or rented from and managed by utilities."

Just last semester I achieved my first scholarship and brought my GPA back up to a 2.8 and was back in good standing with the school from years ago when I dropped out.  I feel a little cheated, because I was under the impression that this was an Engineering degree.  Only after I paid for these classes and made a resume including \"Engineering\" as my degree, was I corrected that this was an \"Engineering Technology\" degree.  I feel like I'm out a few thousand dollars and I'm not completely sure if this will be the right decision for me!  I have absolutely no problem with the math or science of an engineering degree.  That's why I decided to switch to engineering!  But they referred me to a school for an ABET accredited ET BS in Florida, and I think that would qualify me for the PE license?  So do I rip the bandaid now and switch back to an Engineering AA??  I don't even know if I'll be able to afford an ABET accredited BA without obtaining a job in the field with some kind of tuition reimbursement, and that will put me another semester behind!"

Regardless, tickets run about $2.50 each for a ride.  With nearly 1.7 billion rides per year and a budget for the MTA of about $17 billion.   It seems to be a $10 subway ride isn't the end of the world, considering how expensive a cup of coffee is in that town.  Also, the other issue I had, it seems that if I took the train, it didn't matter if it was just a couple stations or all the way up to Harlem from the Financial District, I paid the same price unless I changed lines. That doesn't make sense from the cost to the system my ridership incurs: weight, volume on the train at rush hour, etc.   It seems that a short ride should be more affordable than a long one, as an example. Prepay a full-price fair, but if you exit early, then you get some back into your account. Either than, or try a toll road system of payment where you pay as you go down the system through RFID on a card or something. I may have it wrong though."

Even if the center can counteract for any minute disruption it can only send the ball out of the center.  My point was, by translating the surface during the impact, spin could be induced.  This effectively dampens translation forces, creating a “pull” towards the center.   The spin can then be negated on the next bounce by translating the surface opposite.  It’s only an idea, the feed back loop sounds horrendous at this point and given the sensors may be secondary to the delay.  How do you infer spin?"

    - text: "OP, you’re seriously letting this guy pull the wool over your eyes and it’s sad. His first point concerning luxury is completely off base. Luxury does not necessarily mean durable. It mean high quality. High quality items can still break because they’re a lot more complex. It’s the same reason Toyota’s last a lot longer than expensive luxury cars. If you want to go buy a Nokia brick phone I’m sure it’ll last you for as long as you live if thats what you’re after.  Also, his point saying how as a repair person he sees a lot of Apple products is obviously going to be true considering Apple products are overwhelmingly owned by consumers. There’s way more Apple products being used than other brands and that means there’s more chances for a person who needs a repair to have an Apple product.   Many of the “problems” he brought up weren’t even really true problems. I’m sure a select few encountered the iPhone 6 bend/flex problem, but everyone in my family and a lot of my friends have owned an iPhone 6 and not one of them have ever showed any signs of bending.   He also likes to bring up the fact that people were unable to turn on their laptops because of a problem that could only be fixed under warranty if they turned on their laptops - which happened to be a very very old laptop, but he conveniently forgets to mention that Apple fixed iPhone batteries that had problems or MacBook keyboards for very little to no charge at all which I found out first hand was a very easy and simple solution. Not once did I feel like Apple was screwing me unless it was due to something I caused like dropping and cracking my screen. Again luxury doesn’t mean it’s built like a tank.   Finally, as an engineer which I assume you’re not, you can’t expect to have a 100% success rate with everything especially when it’s on the cutting edge of technology. You seem shocked to hear this as if every single brand out there doesn’t have these problems and has an equal or better product. You might not be an Apple hater but the guy in the video definitely is and he’s selectively picking and choosing things and twisting them to trick gullible people into believing the nonsense he’s saying."

    - text: "I have a few things to add on to this video, which were touched on briefly, but not necessarily in the scope of the video. 3D printing \\*is\\* a new process and we're learning more about it, but for some parts, it is definitely a cost benefit.  Consider both RelativitySpace and SpaceX -- both of these companies currently 3D print their rocket chambers. These get very hot during operation, and you could definitely destroy the chamber within seconds if you don't have a way to cool them. Conventionally, the process is that you have to mill the cooling channels. The larger the chamber, the more channels you have to mill. Sometimes these channels can have bifurcations which can even further increase machining time. Then, you have to close out the channels somehow.   1, you can try electronickel plating, a process that takes a long time (and requires a large bath).   2, you can try laser cladding (a process similar to DMLS - requires a machine).   3, you can try to \"shrink fit\" a jacket onto the chamber - but if your tolerances aren't exactly right, the jacket will not properly bond to half of the channels.  Something that was touched on in the video was the cost and number of machines required to make 3D printing sustainable, and used the chambers as an example -- then proceeded to use injection molding as a counterexample for kicking out parts quickly. Try to MIM a bunch of finished chambers at one time -- go ahead, I'll wait.   The fact is, making these chambers with conventional manufacturing techniques also takes a long time, and also requires multiple machines (for each process step) if you want to increase part output. For these chambers, if speed is of the most importance (think about it -- delaying launch dates ALSO costs money), I think 3D printing is the way to go. Hell, for a lot of smaller parts, 3D printing could save a lot of money.   Of course, you wouldn't send your model of a conventionally machined part and ask the vendor to print it. The part should be designed for 3D printing (and hopefully, with the idea of no machining to light machining afterwards -- otherwise you haven't done the process its justice). As you would design a part for conventional manufacturing, you would design it for 3D printing -- perhaps you could include a non-solid \"in-fill\" to reduce part weight while still retaining overall strength. You wouldn't design a part to have an \"overhang\", where it has to build solid material on top of loose powder; and if you did, proper support structure would be put in place so that it could be built effectively. To maximize output, you could include multiple parts on the same build plate (and they don't even have to be the same part) -- the video showed a few frames of impellers being stacked on a build plate, but didn't really talk about this point.    Also, The stress relief process is so extremely important in all 3D printed parts. When you print, you have to attach the part to something (a build plate) and in the process of fusing the layers together you create so many internal stresses. The video talked about trying to remove internal stresses with different scan structures (5 mm squares are pretty big, if you think about the fact that the powder grains are 40µm big in diameter), but the most important part is the annealing. Obviously, you have to separate the part from the build plate at some point, but if you try to bandsaw or EDM the part off, parts (especially larger parts) are more likely to \"potato chip\" or warp."

We should point out the important work female and male engineers have done, but I wouldn't hold my breath that someday 50% of engineers will be women. Just like I don't expect that someday 50% of early childhood teachers will be men. We shouldn't stop anyone from pursuing whatever they want. But we shouldn't expect equality of results. Men and women are different. And that's ok.  Give them equal opportunities and treat them equally. That's what we should strive for. I don't know if opportunities are currently completely equal.

Inmy wife's hospital they have 20 icu beds per 1000 beds, that's ridiculously low compared to the 5% needed.       We're talking about a constant flow pump here so the pacient has time to die of infections and organ failures before he sufocates to death.       I agree with the sentiment, we have a process for a reason, and we have institutions in place for a reason, to bypass all that is a sure way to get things wrong and get people killed. But consider this, the same principle applies to treatements and medication and in times like this they still apply untested dangerous, full of side effects antivirals. From the antivirals used for HIV to the malaria drug to increase Zink adoption in the cell none of those has had a proper study, but not giving them is considered unethical. In the same light not having someone hoocked up to a noise machine made by an engineer but not FDA approved, should be in the same category."

That implies that it may partially be relying on the surface traction to be consistent and of a friction level within whatever tolerance range it assumes dry pavement to be.  It does not seem to gradually bleed off speed nor accommodate any significant difference in tire grip.  What happens in rain, on a gravel or sandy surface, in snow, on ice, etc?  I assume it just rear ends everything every time in any situation that isn't ideal.  With the modern and quite functional adaptive cruise control, I would VERY much expect the system to blend to the traffic speed and maintain a moderate driving distance, especially due to the very high differences in braking distance between cars and semis.  As much as this is supposed to tout the tech, which is interesting, I can only think of all the ways it could fail horribly just because it doesn't operate defensively and with high margins which is the ONLY way a semi should drive if autonomous in any way.  Its capabilities are just so vastly lower than all the vehicles around it."

Your rigid parts are more like the resistors.  But they built the building as an engineering marvel.  While they were building that every plastic toy in the US had 'Made in Taiwan' stamped on it's bottom.      So that damper swings forever like a pendulum.  And unlike the very rigid twin towers in New York and surrounding buildings Taipei 101 was built to flex and move with it's surroundings.  There are frequent wind storms and earthquakes.    And building a building like that where it was.  It put it self in the way of strong winds.  From an engineering perspective it was a nightmare.  But it just so happened that everyone who lived on that street was an engineer.    TL:DR  The ball always moves and it was designed to."

Mind you, what you're feeling is of course completely normal in this situation, and it's always going to be awkward if you're applying for a role where you work with the interviewers if it doesn't work out.  In terms of feedback, think of a few key moments in the interview you might want to get feedback on. Were there any particular questions you struggled with? What did the interviewers think of your responses to certain questions. Did you miss any opportunities to talk about X, for example? What did you answer well? Make a note of which responses were a hit or a miss. A lot of interview questions are the same so you'll probably end up answering a lot of the same stuff in your next interview.  I think it's also fair for you to ask what it was that put the other person ahead of you. Sometimes there's a legit reason, like maybe they have a bit more experience so would be easier to train, for example. It will be interesting to see what they say here."

From what I was told by a friend who is a recruiter at Google, it's very rare that you get rejected at that stage - but it is known to happen - probably because they couldn't truly find a spot for you in any group at the company.  My suggestion to you is to simply thank the recruiter for her time and see if you can apply again in 6 - 12 months. Maybe by then you will be able to get through HC.  Sorry."

When I first started applying for jobs, for every 3 applications, I was getting at least one interview. I didn't even apply to many jobs. Maybe 20, got 6 offers. Dazzled everyone by being a 20 yr old graduate - my grades were shit but most employers seemed to be easily impressed. One or two from my town knew who I was since I was my hs' val and young at the time. So that halo carried over. Ended up taking a job at the same company my mother worked, great paying corporate position. Got fired in a week (Oct '19). I hated my former boss for (what I felt at the time) ruining my life over an assumption. I have almost no job experience and a useless degree in English. I got a seasonal job for two months but in my parents' opinion, I've been unemployed for five months now.  I just keep applying. I apply to a minimum of 10 - 15 jobs a day since the day I lost that job. I don't get a single phone call or interview (aside from during the holiday season) but I keep trying. I've been rejected from retail, grocery stores, convenience stores, fast food, warehouses, admin/offices, several cities, school boards, states, and the feds. Businesses small and large. Countless internships. I have no friends, hobbies, or talents. But I don't stop. My only blessing is that I have zero responsibilities or bills. My day consists of applying for jobs, reading, and studying (I'm enrolled in a post bacc program through my uni online).   I have no motivation for anything but getting a decent job. There is nothing special that pushes me forward. I just want to achieve the bare minimum an adult should achieve.

I'm only allowed to work 40 hours a week, I'm often away from my computer and not in a good place to write a meaningful email on my smartphone. Every two or three weeks, I have a block of time when I sit down and listen to all my old voicemails that built up and answer all the old emails that weren't about an imminent issue. (Someone they cannot hire to meet their immediate staffing need is not an \"imminent\" issue for them to deal with their current workload, like responding to you was when you were in the running. Perhaps he was just waiting until he could take the time/care to write something thoughtful.)  I wouldn't take it too personally - some people may be uptight about your history but many others will empathize.  I would NEVER bother to say I'd keep someone in mind for the future if I didn't truly mean that. Instead I'd stick to saying I was sorry about what happened, acknowledge all the work/effort the person made and the inconvenience, and say goodbye with a thank you."

I finished my Masters (English at a mediocre university) in May, during which I had a paid internship. They weren't able to spin up a job for me after I graduated, but they gave me a contract for a short-term project through them that ran out in mid-July. I finally landed a temp position that runs til February at an office doing stuff I'm interested in and getting paid well enough. I'm pretty grateful, even though it's temporary... It's been a rough, unsteady 5 months!  Going back to graduate school was a great decision as it gave me so much room to grow and try professions other than teaching and working in restaurants. If you're interested and it's an option for you, you could apply to graduate programs, and once you get in, do whatever you can to try and get an (ideally paid) internship somewhere and that'll get you going, for sure. Getting a master's didn't automatically generate a job for me, and frankly, I don't think the degree itself is doing too much for me, though it doesn't hurt. The paid internship I had in the office, and the short term project they had me on after it was over, has been really helpful in job interviews as it shows I have office experience.  A lot of graduate programs in the US have tuition waivers that you can get after your first year by teaching a class, tutoring, etc. I imagine it's similar in the UK."

She told me I needed to \"deal with it\" and that not attending wasn't an option.  The deadline I missed was related to a non-exigent writing project that she assigned me the last day I was there. I fully intended on completing it between sessions, but ended up sleeping longer than expected while laying down to rest. The next day I told her I needed some additional time since I had little energy due to the cold, and she got extremely upset. A few days later the PIP was created.  I'll also add - my condition worsened while I was there, which I told her about as well, but she discouraged me from seeing a doctor and asked me to self-medicate since I needed to be present at each session of the 5-day event (she said something about not letting a cold be an excuse).

This took me a long time to get the hang of, there's definitely an art to it.  As for getting ripped on for being \"lazy\" or having soft, clean hands; I found that pretty easy to \"own\", since that's precisely the reason I wanted out of grunt work.

I never planned to work in retail, but I had to because I finished a master's and couldn't find a job afterwards. The managment, my coworkers and even the customers are fine. I haven't had any serious trouble at that place. However, going there when you know how much money and work you put on your education is an extremely painful experience.  I'd need to work many hours to be able to live independently, and my quality of life would be very low, as I wouldn't be able to afford proper housing, a vehicle, hobbies that don't involve retail or emergency savings. This is something doable for a short period of time, but takes a toll on your health in the long run. For this reason, I'm doing my best to get out of retail.   Unfortunately, escaping this position means volunteering and getting low paid gigs on the side to built the experience for a better job. I'm working hard to get into marketing, but this is something that might take time and lots of $$$ that tomorrow I might not have. Entry level retail such as cashier and sales associate is one of the lowest jobs in terms of skills that one can accept, so I wouldn't be able to leverage my experience for something better if I were working full time.  On top of everything, I'm an introvert who likes some challenge. Constantly smiling to customers, asking them the same questions every 5 minutes, folding panties and price tagging bras is an emotionally draining experience.  I can't see anything positive about my retail job except for that I'm making a little bit of money to finally transition to a proper career, which isn't to say much as I wouldn't need thos job if I had succeed to launch as soon as I finished college. Retail provides nothing of value to me."

What I would do differently is stop going to the manager from here on out.  You've stated your case, you've shown evidence, they've done nothing about it.    Document everything.  Every word she says and every meeting thus far; every refusal to give you the equipment you need to do your job, etc.  It is very hard and it will feel like you're reliving it but it is so important to do this.  The reason for this is so that if this place decides they want you out and you can't find another job quickly, you have proof of what happened.  You can consider filing for unemployment, or suing if you find out you have legal grounds (unfortunately bullying still isn't illegal but if the harassment gets especially nasty or there is other evidence of legally-protected harassment/hostility such as racism, sexism, etc. you might end up having a case).   If you end up out of a job or decide to leave, consider hiring a professional reference-checking company to see what they say about you (something I should've done) and have that conversation about what they plan on telling future employers about you so that you can be on the same page when job-hunting if you list the job in your history.    In the meantime, when she tells you how to do your job, go ahead and tell her politely but firmly that you know how to do it.  Don't JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain).  She's not your boss.  Doing this with a toxic person just feeds the fire and oftentimes that's all they're really looking for is attention.  That said, it's a good idea to remember how dangerous people who have been honing their socially predatory skills since grade school can be.  Keep your distance, remain polite, do your job but definitely keep your distance.  I can't stress that enough.  Take the time to separate yourself from this stress outside of work and take care of yourself; sleep well, eat well and get enough exercise.    Also if you're on Facebook there is a group called Workplace Dignity (they also have a blog) with people dealing with these issues in their lives.    There are other pages on Facebook and also elsewhere online against workplace bullying such as the Workplace Violence Prevention Institute, Healthy Workplace Bill advocates in many states (I used to follow Massachusetts for example which posted many very informative articles and insight into workplace bullying).

How am I supposed to work with someone who makes unwanted sexual comments about me and wants me and the woman I love to die and thinks we deserve to die? I'm willing to quit my job if I have to work with that person again, and I have informed my HR the same (I am getting training in a different department currently until sometime in September). They pretty much just told me that I don't have to interact with this person and that they hope I don't have to quit. They said they \"handled it\" and that I don't have to interact or speak with this coworker, but they are still making me work next to her in September. Doesn't that count as interaction? We would be standing next to or across from the other. They still expect me to continue to work next to this person once my training is over and I simply refuse. I just don't think any of this should be tolerated, and they seem to not actually be doing anything about it. To be honest, personally I do think she should be fired because I don't think this should be tolerated at all, but I would feel so much better if I could just move to a different part of the factory, I don't really have that option unless someone else quits.  HR's legal responsibility is to make sure that the harassment stops.  It is not to make sure that you never have to be in the same room with this person again.  They cannot and should not tell you what they have done to your coworker as a consequence.  You do not get to decide how they sanction a coworker.  Emailing the head of HR makes you look, frankly, unstable and like someone I would not want to keep around.  And to those who say: HR is not your friend.  That is very true.  It's also true that your manager is not your friend.  The chief custodian is not your friend.  The CFO is not your friend.  Work is for friendly interaction but not friends.  Finally, quit having your SO contact your coworkers.  Things that happen at work are between you and work.  Again, it makes you look unstable and like a liability."

LOL it’s very much a “getting things done at the 11th hour” & “hurry up and wait” type of industry. I think doing things right away will actually be a benefit in the long run as the longer you are at the job the more responsibilities will pile up.... and it becomes a bigger risk to procrastinate... also I’ve learned the hard way that procrastination leads to anxiety... so you’d be right back where you started. So me the question is about priority. If you ask a “when would you like this done” ... every person will respond saying ASAP because they don’t have any concept of what you are working on at that very moment. I’d strategically ask your question about deadline in a way that also asks which is the real priority... so saying “I will get this done. I’m currently working on XYZ and have X hours more to finish it. I expect I can get this to you by X time. Does that work for you?”  This will remind them what you are working on AND gives them the opportunity to say “yes that time frame works” or “no I need you to do this first”. Either way you get the real answer you need and not the generic go to answer of “asap”. It also manages up which is a great way to communicate your efforts without blatantly saying “I did This, This, and This, today”.   Then with time you’ll get a real sense of what is actually pressing and what’s not, but always a good idea to manage up regardless. :) hope that helps!"

    - text: "hey mate, I read your other post, so I'll reply here.  I don't know what you sell, but I can give you some tips for selling anything.   Basically the first thing you want to do is identify what level of investment your customer/client is making in purchasing goods and/or services from you.  Basically, there are a zillion combinations of product/service, but you can boil almost anything down to a fundamental relationship that is this: all sales fall somewhere along the line connecting two extremes, the extremes are:  1. Low price point, service means nothing since the item is likely consumable and you'll never have to see the retailers ugly mug again  2. Extremely high pricepoint, where you're purchasing a high end product that is irrevocably paired with strenuous, rigorous service - and, by buying this product or service you are tied into a relationship with the seller. (Examples might be hiring a specialized consultant to build a model of a highly complex system, or hiring a lawyer, or purchasing a fleet of Boeing 747's) - in all these cases, you're going to be locked into a relationship for some period of time, sometimes your whole life.  The point here, is that as the seller you need to be cognoscente of the investment the consumer must make in the purchase of your product. If you are selling paper - are you *just* selling paper, or are you selling the service agreement in which you will provide them with paper for a period of time?  If you are selling something relatively inexpensive, your focus should not be on YOU, the focus should be on the product, and economy. If you are selling something more expensive, then you must start to sell yourself as a reliable provider, as well as the product.  In a project management course I took recently, there is a \"goal\" of becoming a \"trusted advisor\". This means that you speak to your client with truth - not sales; but truth. Meaning, that you aren't acting solely to benefit your pocket, or your company's revenue, but you are speaking to them with their best interests at heart. And by doing this, you gain significant good will. Sometimes this comes cheaply, and sometimes it comes at significant expense.  Here are two examples: A client approaches me and asks me to compare and contrast the model we built and the model they had from a couple years ago. I realise immediately that their previous model was built in a very robust way, and contains several tertiary level calculations that I know my junior engineers could not possibly  do. I tell my client that the previous work is at a standard that surpasses the work I have just provided him. He agrees, but then instead of getting mad, he asks what I can do to remediate the situation. I say we can use the client's previous model as a basis for improvement and we adopt some specific modules to the higher standard. We cover the work under training, since I know my junior engineers will learn something valuable. The client is extremely happy and as a result we are awarded with more work.  Example 2: I submit a proposal for some work and the client is considering two different software types to accomplish the job. We are specialised in only one of them. We realise quickly that the training time on the othr software would make our bid uncompetitive. I tell the client that we are not in a position to make a bid on the work because of this issue. They appreciate our position and award the project to someone else. Here, we've been honest up front and the client appreciated our forthcoming attitude and honesty. We lost $150k worth of work, but we gained credibility.  In either case, it's the cost of doing business, but by gaining good will and credibility we're putting ourselves continually in a better position.  The TL;DR here, is that you can find ways to be honest with the client, be honest about everything and it'll pay off. a 10% increase in sales will not be difficult with a bit of time spent getting to know your clients, or knowing what to focus on.  Ohya, and I wouldn't be worried about getting the axe. Don't stress that - that's just paying interest on a debt you haven't incurred."

I'd also suggest seeking professional help through counseling to help overcome these issues. This stuff is easier to fix now than later in life when it gets worse. Believe me, you aren't the only one going through it, particularly when you work so hard to get things done. One of the biggest problems I see brewing in the future of work for those of us under 35 is burnout and fatigue. If you've been formally educated and put your finances on the line to get a good career, then you're going to feel stress that it may go wrong at any moment. And it can and will go wrong. There may be a day you walk in and it's your last day. Trust me when I tell you that day may actually be a blessing and you can find something else that will satisfy you more than your current work.  &#x200B;  All this to say OP, don't let work define you as much.

Girls like that can kind of suck the life out of you sometimes :( One day I decided I had enough of my co-worker's snobby, narcissistic and controlling personality--and I wasn't going to let this woman-child walk all over me. So, brace yourself, but you have to talk this out with her. Chances are she's not the kind of person who's been called out before, so this is just as good for you as it is for her!  &#x200B;  Definitely don't start with an \"I think you're a toxic person\" opener because then she'll know that you've been hating on her for a really long time; I would assume she would act out (get passive aggressive or snobby) just because no one likes getting called out; it's a defense mechanism. Instead, pick an isolated incident--like if she ever puts you down by saying \"Ew, don't wear that\" then, I'd recommend in the next 10 minutes to an hour, that you ask to speak with her away from everyone else so you can tell her that you don't appreciate it when she says flippant comments like that. Maybe one of these lines would work for you: \"Hey, can I ask you something?\" or \"Let's go get a coffee\" or \"Let me put time on my calendar so we can chat. When are you free?\" Anything neutral like that to get her away if you work in a group so she doesn't feel like she's being called out unprofessionally. Once you have that down--ease into it and say something like: \"Hey, when you said/did *that*, it made me feel really shitty/disrespected and I want to make sure this stops\" or \"Maybe you didn't pick up on it, but when you do or say *that*, it's really unprofessional and I'd rather you kept it to yourself\" Sandwich it with something like \"I really like how you're such a hard worker and you show initiative in the office\" or \"I like your style and would love to hit you up for advice sometime\" --Something that is positive and that shows you respect, at least one part, of who she is.  &#x200B;  Remember--Why are you letting her determine how YOU feel? Once you stop putting her needs before yours, you'll see that it's necessary to advocate for yourself. Don't expect an immediate change, but do expect some push back. When I called out my co-worker, I wasn't prepared for her to go into a crying fit and explain to me that she has a lot of stress in her life/lots of father issues and that sometimes she's mean and just doesn't even realize it. Historically, I'm not the type of person to stick up for myself--I've always minimized my feelings in those situations and it honestly felt so good to A) understand why she is how she is and B) to rally for my fucking self. You can do this gently and in a way that is genuine to your attitude and lifestyle. Don't get worked up, don't shout, don't engage. Just state how you feel (show your vulnerability) and it's up to her how she reacts.   &#x200B;  Another thing to think about is making sure you can dot your i's and cross your t's--she could call you out for \"doing nothing\" so really look at your work performance so she doesn't manipulate this back on you. If she brings that up again, you can say that's something you'll be happy to work on. If she is just actually that awful to work with, you should escalate it to your boss or your HR department **AFTER** you've attempted to fix the situation. They will be happy to cut off the poison on the team if it means keeping good workers.   &#x200B;  Good luck! You've got this! Let me know if this worked for you?"

Here are my suggestions:  1) Talk to someone (a therapist, if your benefits allow for it or if you have some money) I was in the same rut and I felt like I couldn’t be happy. I started seeing a therapist about 8 months ago and it has given me a lot of perspective on my life. They help you connect the dots on what you need but you don’t realize it.  2) Meditate. I use an app called Calm and it’s guided meditation (because I hate silence) it’s $60/year but I know there are other rates you can do (monthly, one time payment, etc.). There is a meditation series for everything. There is one on mindfulness at work that helps with stress and work ethic. People have a hard time believing that slowing your day down increases productivity. TRUST ME, slowing down your day will help. What I mean by that is take time and do 15 minutes of meditation, slow down the racing thoughts and learn to look at things with a different perspective. In the words of Tom and Donna from Parks and Rec, Treat yo self.” Spend some time learning about yourself and your thoughts. Don’t be afraid to take a breather, the human body tells you when it needs it.  3) Find what you enjoy (easier said than done, right? WRONG) what do you truly enjoy in life? For me, it’s computers and video games. So what I did was I started studying for different certifications to understand computer related items and how video games are made.  Now, your thinking, “But I have no motivation to do it.” The biggest mistake you can make is giving yourself a “made-up” timeline. All this does is create an unrealistic expectation for yourself and frustrate you when you fall behind. Think of it this way, each day is an investment into your future. The fact that you thought about doing certifications tells me all I need to know about you. You are motivated, but maybe you don’t know where to start. One day at a time (as cliche as it sounds) but trust me, thinking so far out in the future will overwhelm you.   My parting thoughts:  YOU CAN DO IT"

Coming in to work and letting your boss see that you are indeed unfit for work is the way to go. Deciding for yourself is not.   As a boss, I'm trying to run a business and need as much notice as possible. Being short handed can cost hundreds of dollars in product loss, loss of sales and set back production for the entire day.

But no company is obligated to give you a job even if you really will work your ass off and expressed your passionate interest in the type of work.

Poor workers are an expensive anchor, they don’t produce at an acceptable level for the cost.    Mid-level workers keep the company going.

Six Sigma *without the lean* is more of an all or nothing, my way or the highway attidude that only works when senior management is fully onboard.  PMP is the defacto 'gold standard' when it comes to project management credentials. Unlike L6S, is is exclusive and proprietary to the PMI organization (with L6S you have several strong choices for certification).  PMP is a tough exam, and rumour has it that they maintain a 50% failure rate to keep it elite.   Unfortunately, PMI has double-downed on its emphasis of Agile methologies into it's flagship PMP credential, which may stengthen it in IT circles, but at the same time distance it in relevance to other industries where Agile has not caught on and likely never will, such as Construction, Manufacturing, Supply Chain, Advertising, and Event Planning.  Unfortunately, nothing has emerged to challenge PMP dominance in the PM certification space...  So, are you are looking for a credential for immediate impact, PMP will do the trick - but there is a growing dissatisfaction in what it represents... so, tomorrow - who knows.  As L6S has grown in popularity within Supply Chain, Manufacturing, Health Care, it has lost favor in IT and technology integration...

Of course if your guest blog posts match up if the interests of the companies you're applying for, that's even better.

God, this is so similar to my situation, even down to the niche sports blog thing, except I'm not fortunate enough to be currently working as a writer of any sort (stuck in a dead-end administrative/sales position - yuck). Honestly I would kill for a job in technical writing.  I don't know if this is right, but it's what I'm doing: put all of your creative projects/portfolios at the top of your resume with hyperlinks to your work and leave off any irrelevant jobs you might have held unless it's your only paid work experience. I've been applying thinking you have to put paid work experience first, but I'm beginning to realize that if you don't have relevant experience (personal projects ARE experience) on the top third of your resume, hiring managers send you straight to the reject pile without so much as glancing at anything on the bottom 2/3 of the resume or looking at additional writing samples/portfolios you might send with your application. (Seriously, HR people seem to be the laziest, most clueless people I've ever had to deal with; you basically have to spell out everything for them on your resume like they're 3 years old. They want their jobs to be easy, so make it easy for them by front-loading the crap out of your resume with work examples.)  I think in this industry, demonstrating that you can write creative content is perhaps the most important thing. It shows employers what skill set you already possess and what you're capable of. I can't tell you what marketing managers might be looking for, but in my experience looking at job postings, most of them want at a bare minimum demonstrated proficiency with WordPress, AP style (or occasionally Chicago style), professional-looking photographs, some familiarity with HTML and CSS, and most of them also want to see that you have experience managing social media pages for a company (in this situation I've simply made social media pages to correspond with my blog). Upper-entry level positions might want anything from video editing experience, web design experience, graphic design experience, and/or require you to be an \"expert\" with certain software like Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, or Photoshop. Startups and small to mid-sized companies seem to have more relaxed experience requirements; large companies usually seem to want everything I mentioned above for the most basic entry-level positions, plus administrative, HR, and data analysis experience and a bunch of other random stuff on the side.  Edited to add - I don't know how much companies care about blog views, but I think it would only help you. I only get a few dozen views per blog post on mine, but then again I'm writing about a recreational ice hockey league in an area that doesn't give a crap about ice hockey. I think it's probably more important that you show you can do the work, and the work speaks for itself."

Virtually all jobs in student affairs are master's-required. If you want to have a chance, you will need to get a specific student affairs master's degree. Unfortunately, your food science master's degree will not help you one bit in this field.  Luckily, most master's programs in student affairs will accept students from any background - as long as you can articulate on your application that you are passionate about helping college students, you'll be golden. People who work in higher ed come from all kinds of backgrounds. It's an extemely diverse field, and prides itself on being so diverse.  A few warnings: it's a very competitive field. You'll probably spend a few years while in grad school overworked and underpaid as an \"intern\" (even though your responsibilities and hours will be comparable to a professional), and then still might to struggle to get a job after all the effort.   In addition, I hope you aren't attached to where you live, because it will be expected that you do a national job search after graduating. If you are selective about which colleges you apply to for full-time work, you will just be holding yourself back. Take whatever you can get, anywhere in the country. Some people end up working at the same college where they got their master's, or in the same area, or at the college in the next town over - but many people do not - so be open to traveling. Furthermore, promotions are rare, so once you have learned all you need to from a job, be ready to move across the country yet again to take on a higher-level position.  If that kind of workload, and those warnings, don't bother you, then absolutely go for it.  And if you want to know more, go to your current school's career services office and make an appointment. I can almost guarantee you that every career counselor went through a student affairs master's program, and they can tell you what the career field is like.  One last thing: the student affairs field is made up of so many people that you'll really have to come to your own conclusions. I'm trying to be a realist here, but some people will say it's only positive and fun, some will say you don't actually need a master's, and some people are extremely toxic. Everyone who works in student affairs has a different perspective about it.   Sorry not sorry for the long answer. Consider yourself informed.

This is usually a very experienced development officer (fundraiser), who is good at identifying the donors' interests and giving capacity and finds a way to connect it to a major funding opportunity.    It's a long process -- up to a couple of years, in part because tax issues are often involved -- and it is essentially a weird form of sales. What you are selling is the satisfaction of doing good to a rich person who's got money to spare and maybe wants to be remembered for more in life than building a lot of luxury apartment buildings.    One of our old major donors just passed; he was a former engineer turned real estate developer, and his donations alone laid the foundation for a real engineering division at our otherwise liberal-arts-heavy university.  It of course has his name on it.  Development officers are often \"guns for hire\" who drift from university to university; but some of them come up from the ranks of university administration -- usually by getting involved with fundraising for whatever department or program they work for -- and go from there.   I would actually encourage you to look at university employment.  I don't know what \"macro\" social work is, but the university I work for has actual social workers on staff, a variety of student assistance prorams, a food program, a \"student success\" program, advising positions of various types beyond simple academic advising, and more.

I highly advise your friend to take a break from serving first of all since it's a stressful job and it's hard to concentrate on other things when you have that job. Second of all, she should go into some chem./biotech workshops, get as many certificates as she can, and take some short community college/university classes relevant to biochem. or analytical chemistry. She should keep in constant contact with the instructors so that they can help her as much as possible. The courses can be online or just short workshops but they're important as a \"reset\" in her career. She should keep that server experience in her resume to show what she did for the last 3 years and then also show the certificates/classes/workshops she took afterwards. Most employers I know in this industry assume that anyone who just has a degree and no relevant job experience needs to be fully trained so your friend should be mostly on par with other freshly-graduated candidates. She should ask the instructors she developed good connections with to go over her resume and forward her any entry level jobs they might know of.   Then she should apply for some entry-level positions in her field of study (Craigslist often has a bunch). These are mostly low-level technician jobs where people just follow established guidelines (mostly preparing solutions, cleaning glassware, ordering lab supplies, doing basic assays), but that doesn't matter so long as it's slightly relevant to her career. Analytical chemistry is actually pretty good for people who just have a B.S. degree in chemistry/biology and you can easily get on-the-job training and grow your skillset. No matter where her first job is though, she should constantly ask to learn more stuff and connect with as many people as she can. The first relevant job is absolutely the hardest to get in anyone's biochem. career but afterwards she'll become much more valuable and remember the days when she was just a server.  Her opportunities however are limited to her location though. It's much easier to get your foot in the door if you're in an urban biotech [hotspot](https://www.biospace.com/hotbeds), but if she's single, has no kids/ties to her location, I highly advise her moving to her first job for a couple of years until she has experience and then move to where she wants.

Another way of looking at it is that the employer knows he/she can get a more educated person because the market is flooded with people of that background that need a job but could not get it into their fields.   That being said, I've actually encountered the opposite. Many of those type of positions rather have a person that has accumulated 5 years of experience for example, instead of a person with a Bachelor's degree.   Also, many jobs in the business world are clerical in nature. Not everyone is an analyst or a manager. There are many support roles that require specific knowledge of software and processes.

Also, the military is an option (a bachelor's can get you into OCS, provided you meet the other qualifications). There are various other government jobs up for consideration as well, and many of them require a bachelor's degree... no mention of specific concentrations. That goes for federal, state, and local governments. Your GPA also qualifies you for teaching, I believe. Depending on your state, you may be able to work without a certification. There are all kinds of jobs out there for people with these kinds of degrees. Your path may not be completely mapped out for you from day one like it is for some majors, but you have options.

You come from the business world and they’ve come from cs and big companies. Different viewpoints help a company as a whole and you being young to this job (because you’re an intern), you’re not expected to know everything, just a higher general understanding. Maybe on your free time try to learn SQL or other useful skills that could help not only this job, but potential future ones.      B) Talk to your boss and see why he offered you a job to provide some like so you can improve your self doubt. Maybe try mental health consulting if you think you need it (I am just going off of the imposter syndrome you explained).      C) Ask for help from a coworker or two to help train you more? Since you don’t want to move back, view this as some money is better than no money. Think of what tasks you do on a daily basis that you could do better and practice them.      Motivational bit: If you’ve been lucky enough to be selected by them twice, once for interview and once for a job offer, they clearly see something in you that you don’t. You clearly want to stay there and I believe that you can beat this challenge that’s in front of you no problem.

The only thing a degree will really do for you is open up a few job opportunities, some companies are really hung up on only hiring people with a degree. But currently in our field there are plenty of place you can hop around to, if you just want a raise. With 7 years experience you could (probably, I'm not really familiar with the german job market.) easily find a higher paid job without wasting time and money on a degree.

He did it largely because he was bored and the event was free. When he interviewed for a position with a company, the interviewer mentioned that they'd like someone that could be on the \"safety team.\" Turns out that the only requirement was CPR certification. Something like an extra dollar per hour on his payrate.   Google has free courses on some of their marketing tools. That's not exactly a certification, but again could be one more thing to set you apart.  Or start learning a new language. Plenty of apps to get started and other resources available at your library."

I didn't really know how the game worked, back then. But I do now.  So the good news is that there is a lot you can do to improve your chances!  You mentioned that you've applied to 80+ opportunities. This tells me that you're using some standardized process for your applications. You're basically submitting the same resume and a slightly altered cover letter in each, right?  Thing is: if you submit standardized job applications, you're likely to get standardized rejection emails.  As any good communicator knows, you need to tailor your message to your audience.  So the trick is **pick way fewer opportunities** and go all in on those.  So go find a company you would really love to work for and do your research. What do they do, exactly, and how could you, bringing your skills, add value to this company?  I'm sure you can think of something, since you mentioned that you pitched ideas to the companies and that they even ended up using them! I'm sure that really stings. But the harsh reality here is that your ideas were good, but the company just didn't trust you to execute on them.  And that's a problem.  Because, as any startup investor will tell you: ideas are cheap. In the end, it's all about the execution. An investor will sooner invest in a great team with a mediocre idea, than in a questionable team with a great idea.  So you need to make sure the company believes you can execute.  Solution:  **Turn a 'we should' into an 'I did'****.**  For example, instead of saying that the company could improve its copy on the landing page to tailor it more to audience XYZ (cheap idea), go ahead and actually rewrite that copy and submit it with your application!  Another example: instead of saying that the company could improve its marketing by increasing its presence on social media, go ahead and actually create a week's worth of social media content for them!  Not only will this allow you to show off your skills, but it will prove that you can do the job before you even have it!  There is no better signal you can give a potential employer.  Finally: **show genuine excitement** for the job in your application.  A standard cover letter is a terrible medium to express excitement. It's frankly plain dull, impersonal and boring.  Remember that you're marketing yourself!  Would you ever choose a \"dear sir/madam\" letter to market anything else?  Probably not.  Making a video cover letter (like with [crash.co](https://crash.co)) will really help you to express your genuine enthusiasm, as well as your communication skills and willingness to go the extra mile.  &#x200B;  Good luck!"

I've gotten a few jobs that way. Like after college type jobs. Don't rule out Glassdoor either. Even Google pulls up job opportunities if you search for it. There's also temp agencies and employment agencies. It's a good idea to make contacts with the recruiters too.   As far as your resume goes, use a good template. Just make sure to make it your own. I completely redid mine and it made a huge difference. You are in for a bit of a challenge with everything going on. You really need to make sure to stand out. Just keep your resume professional."

Those of us over the age of 40 grew up in the Industrial Age and as such, we have modeled our Socio-Economic-Political Structure based on the Industrial Age.  Go out, get a job, punch a clock, work in a factory or company, etc etc is all ingrained in our society.    However, we are now in the information age.  Unfortunately, the inertia of the Industrial Age is still with us and many people, like yourself, are guided by that inertia.  Don't be.  Learn how to make money using the internet.  Notice I said \"learn\".  Every day as a society we spend billions of hours on the internet doing \"Stuff\".  What you need to do is you need to find a way to provide a service for people that use the internet.  What exactly? I have no effing idea.  All I know is that the internet is a giant sandbox with billions of kids playing every day.  There is an infinite market that you have access to.       What can you do?  Learn how to code, learn how to do Graphic Design, Learn how to do Video Editing,  Learn Social Media, learn about Bitcoin, become an expert at some \"part\" of the internet and then provide some sort of service for people who use the internet.  Maybe you help old people and/or Mom and Pop businesses develop social media profiles, maybe you figure out how to become a virtual assistant and offer your services to affluent types, maybe you build a website selling widgets, maybe you figure out \"something\" that people on the internet can use and you code an app for it....  Here is my advice.    Watch at least 3 seasons of Shark Tank (doesn't matter which 3 seasons, just pick three), read some books on Entrepreneurship and starting your own business.  go through youtube and watch a few hundred hours worth of those annoying \"Here is how I make money using the internet\" scam videos that want you to buy their bullshit courses.  Do the above for 6 months like a machine and \"something\" inside your brain will click on how to make money on the internet.  You will start by working like a dog and making peanuts, in fact, your internet hourly  wage will probably start off around 5 cents an hour, that is, you work for 20 hours trying to get clients, sell widgets, etc and out of that 20 hours someone pays you $10 for a widget.  You work the next 20 hours and make $25 which comes out to 12.5 cents an hour.  You work the next 20 hours and make $50, then the next and make $100, then the next and make $150, then the next and make $400....   By the end of the year, you've figured some stuff out and now are making more than minumum wage on the internet.  By the end of the next year, you have learned even more and are now making $20/hr... by the end of the next year you are making $100/hr....  You have to learn to hunt and gather for yourself.  We are in the information age, stop trying to live by the old rules and paradigm of the Industrial age.  Educate yourself with the internet.  Yes, it will be tough, yes, it will take a lot of hard work, yes you will have to actually study and read and write shit down and learn how to code and use programs from scratch...  but long term, this is your best path.  It is not easy, it will take you a couple of years, but man, longterm it will be worth it.  Another thing that can help is to partner with someone who is in a similar boat as you are in.  You guys decide to form H&F Online Consultants.  H&F stands for Hustle and Flow.  I don't mean hustle in the bad sense, I mean hustle in the Entrepreneurial sense.  You guys help each other learn, motivate each other, spend every day looking at the internet thinking \"how can we scrape some cheddar off of the mountain of cheese in front of us...\"    You grind everyday with the mentality that you are gonna make money doing \"something\".  You are going to find a need, a niche, an edge that you can exploit.    that is my advice.  We are in the information age.  The era of working for others hoping they dole out a salary for you is yesterday's model.  Sure, it will work for most but it is no longer ideal.  There is a sea of money out there on the internet right now, you only need a tiny fraction of a fraction of a fraction to thrive.  Figure out how to get that fraction, learn to carve your own niche."

I don't see any logic hiring less qualified candidates simply because they're employed at the moment. In fact, those that are employed sometimes tend to demand more than companies want to offer simply because they got nothing to lose. When a company considers someone who's unemployed, they understand that you're more motivated to start under their terms simply because you need a job. I've been unemployed since last April because my position got eliminated before contract ran its course but I didn't go out searching for a position immediately because I decided to use this time to finish my Master's degree, so I took my time and got it done and graduated in October. Now when I go to interviews and explain the gap, there are no more questions, in fact some even admitted that taking the time to finish school was a good decision. So, as long as you're doing something to better yourself whilst being unemployed is what matters."

I can't say whether getting fired over this would violate the law in Australia, but I will say that it sounds like a toxic, shitty place to work.  If you really want the job, then you probably have to go over her head.  Send an email or letter to her boss, describe the situation, and ask how you are supposed to enter the order so this doesn't happen, as your manager can not or will not explain it to you.

It also looks good to stay with a job longer so you don't look flighty.    As for confidence in the interviews- fake it until you make it.  Reach out to anyone and everyone to practice interviewing skills.  The more you practice, the more comfortable you feel.  I'm really good at it if you want to message me.  I'd be happy to help."

For women, it's an entirely different matter.      As far as your goals, yes: you would do very well to do the military. Four years really isn't that long of a time and if you have a degree (depending on what the degree is) you'd be able to go in as an officer with better perks, better pay, and a bit of prestige to go along with it. There's more politics involved, but I won't get into that. The reason why I'd tell anybody to get into the military is the Post 9/11 GI Bill. Imagine four years of free college and books AND getting paid the BAH rate of whatever you're in. I'm finishing off the last few semesters of mine right now and getting an additional $2500 a month to just go to school is really nice. Most schools have these programs already set up so all you do is get your COE, apply for classes, and that's it.      My real concern is with you being a female and what happens in the dark underbelly of the military...the shit they don't talk about.      This is going to sound like I'm bad mouthing the military, but a lot of dumb ass mother fuckers join the military. Most people have their reasons (you seem very intelligent) but the mass majority aren't. A lot of people join the military because they can't hack it in the civilian world, couldn't/wouldn't get a degree, or chose the military over jail. These are the people that you'll be working with.      I personally know two females. I'm in contact with one but lost contact with the other a few years after I got out. Both were raped. It's a thing that doesn't really get talked about unless one of them rapes a civilian and there's massive amounts of sexism happening.      Now, this is all context: I was in the Navy, so if you're to join the military, it has to be the Air Force. Any other branch brings you too close to shit heads that are only there because they had no other choice, and the Air Force will have waaaaaay better opportunities to take what you learn out into the civilian world and thrive.      Feel free to DM me as there's so much I could write on here but I don't want to write my book either. ;)"

So if I were chosing between a school like Akron and a small lib arts school, I'd probably consider cost / debt after you graduate and also just the usual stuff that might be important to you - convenience if you are going to live from home, what student life is like etc.  The other factor is a some schools do better than others when it comes to career placement etc.  And others really have some insane networking going on, both among the alumni and between the alumni and upcoming and recent grads - to the point where you can get interviews or nearly even offers outright if an alumnist works where you are applying, etc."

They all agreed that while the classroom learning was nice, the real value lies in 1. making connections with other successful businesspeople and / or 2. getting a degree was necessary for a promotion in their current job. They also agreed that all of the course contents could be easily found in books and online courses.  Honestly I think your real problem is your expectations. If I understand your post correctly, you hope that if you get a master’s degree, you will be able to change careers. Many people (including myself) have undertaken master’s degrees with this hope. What these people fail to understand is that experience is far more important than education and that sitting in a classroom does not give you job experience. Entry-level jobs require experience and you need at least an internship in a relevant field to be considered for something. Just to use myself as an example, after getting my master’s in a new field I was not even considered for secretarial-level jobs which didn’t require a college degree. This was because I had no actual job experience in that field. I know this is quite anecdotal but if you go on r/jobs or similar forums you can see stories from masters and PhD grads who have been going for months or years without being able to land a job in their chosen field.  Compounding your problem if you want to change careers is that you plan to study in Belgium. Actually I can empathize with you since I got my master’s in a foreign country as well. But this brings with it a lot of problems. First and foremost is not being able to use the resources of the school to get employment. Are you an EU citizen? If not then campus recruitment events and the connections of your profs are pretty much useless since you are not going to be working in Europe. Then you will be stuck cold applying to jobs on LinkedIn that already have 600+ applicants. Trust me, that is not a fun place to be.  Basically, I would advise you not to get a master’s unless you know that 1. The degree is in high demand and 2. You have a plan for getting practical experience during your study. I guess with something like data science that another commentator suggested, that would look like having an internship during your study period AND coming out with strong coding skills and example projects that you could show employers. Not easy to accomplish in the typical 2-year period of a master’s degree but possible for sure. I think that a master's in educational studies makes a lot of sense for you. Since you already have five years of experience teaching, you will be well-positioned to job hunt after you get that degree. But if you are set on getting out of education, then obviously you would need to study a different major.  Just a side note since you mentioned possibly working in HR in the comments: you need HR experience. I graduated with an advanced degree in an HR-related field, publications, conference presentations, HR analytics skills with projects to demonstrate them, etc. Couldn’t even get a job as an HR clerk in positions which didn’t require a college degree. HR is heavily connected to legal compliance and most companies will look for someone who has experience with the legal / regulatory aspects of HR because it opens companies up to lawsuits if the job is done incorrectly. I think other fields would be a lot easier to break into as a new grad and I did find a job in a non-HR field. But that is just my anecdotal experience, take that with a grain of salt if you really have a passion for HR."

Same for GPA, as long as it's decent then no one will really care unless you want to stay in academia. Projects and actual work are far more important.   The difference where prestige really matters is more on the professional network side of who you meet and what opportunities they connect you with, but again it is perhaps largely luck based and any decent uni will have some opportunities to meet good people.   The flip side is that it can be better to be a top student at a 2nd tier school rather than middle of the pack or lower at a top tier school, not just from the competitive stress but also from the investment the professors have in you and helping you to succeed."

In my previous workplace (professional services in a big uni in London), we had a work experience placement for college students, and most of them hadn't decided yet what they wanted to do but they wanted to see how working in an office is like. A lot of young people (including myself a few years ago) have preconceived ideas of what it means to have a desk job or how workload is distributed between departments. I've always worked in non-profit environments (so not a lot of money-making here) but I've always had tons of interaction and opportunities for leadership. I'd recommend that you check out different industries and roles, talk to older friends, etc to get a sense of the kind of culture you'd feel comfortable in and take it from there.  Also, it's important that you study something that you actually enjoy doing because once you're in a course and you have to take exams, the motivation of \"this is going to give me a lot of money in the future\" simply won't be enough. When I was in uni, I had so many classmates that didn't like studying languages and struggled for years with their Chinese classes...

To give you some perspective, I work in marketing. The jobs go to people who have connections and experience. Most places could careless if you have a MBA.

Most companies would pay for you to go back to school if you need it, so its not worth going to graduate school immediately after completing your undergrad.  My advice, when you get into college begin networking the moment you step foot on campus. Join AMA (American Marketing Association) as early as possible. I heavily recommend interning every summer, ideally for a well known company. The internship(s) will give you some experience, but most importantly, connections within those organizations.

Fore most, a bachelor in biology, biochem, or chemistry isnt really enough to get the good salary because your competion are those with master and doctor degree. U will most likely need to pursue a master or doctor if u want a good salary. Also a good salary vary...  As for school, it only matter if u looking foward toward a concentration or career. What do i mean by this? Most of the classes of biology are the same regardless where u go, however some schools offer concentrations other university may not. For example, in california; the univeristy in the bay have marine biology as a concentration while those in the central valley dont. Some university offer wild life biology as a concentration and some dont. Some university focus more on medicine sides of biology. Biology is so broad especially at an undergrad level.  When pursing your undergrad, talk to your professors especially the one who focus in your concentration. Get to know them and ask them how u can help on their researchs. For example, when i was taking my pre req for biology, i joined a field biology club and talk to the professor. He offer me a part time position to help with data entry regard to species phenotypes. This experience allow to understand how field biology was different than lab work.  The science u will need to know are physics, chemistry, and biology. The program will teach u and discipline u so dont worry about it for now.  If u go toward biology or any science major, i really really recommend getting a master or doctor afterward.But for me, i got what i needed and took my analaytical skills to run a business because that where my passion align.  I truly recommend majoring in biology, it's an amazing journey and u will learn so much about the natural world.

Much of what I learned in the last ten years (machine learning, Big Data stuff, etc.) has been self-taught from online courses and practicing when opportunities arose at my jobs, but if I didn't have that base from undergrad, it would have all been impossible.    Even then it took quite a bit of discipline on my part to do the self-study (more than I can muster these days to be honest) because...well, you don't have the validation of professor or mentor suggesting that this investment of your time and energy is worthwhile or leading somewhere.  Plus, employers still aren't sure what to make of skills developed through self-study, so the piece of paper from a reputable institution just gets your foot in the door in ways that some line items on your resume about some online courses you took can accomplish.  So, if getting into analytics is going to be full change of gears with a ground-up development of new skills and knowledge, it might be worth going for the education.  Otherwise, it's worth getting out into the working world and seeing what experiences you can drum up as an entry-level analyst, trying to grow and build your skills outside of work in parallel."

The training time is a small pay cut, but because of the extra hours I will be putting in, I will actually make more than I am now...and even more once I am given a store.  I was very honest about my pursuit of education, as it is very important to me. I switched my major in January to a Bachelor of General Studies with a concentration in Public Health. During my interview with the Regional Manager and his District Manager, both were intrigued when I said I picked something that would apply to my real world experience. I made sure to mention classes, such as OSHA training. I also mentioned that I was simply looking to look better on paper and wasn't necessarily looking for any major career changes.   I am in my forties and a looking towards the future. Whatever I can do make myself look better and grow is a plus. Where I am at right now, I am the top of the food chain, and if something should happen to the Owner, I am out of a job. This new job offers a lot of benefits that I do not have and an immense room for growth. I have been primary to my job and schooling in my free time...but I will need some time for a few classes on campus and intend on working them in on my off days. Even now, I have too much responsibility to do otherwise. I do worry because I will need to put in at least five extra hours a week. There will also be 5 mandatory lunch hours a week. I haven't had a lunch break in 20 years, so plan on using that as study time.  I will miss my short and zero dollar commute, though.   I have two weeks to make a decision."

If you're looking at a regular university, then you have to take a lot more into consideration.  First, how much schooling are you willing to do? Computer science often terminates at bachelors and you go job hunting. The job hunt in Europe for CS is not the same as in the United States. Immigrating here for something like that is even harder and you'll likely face discrimination. Most econ bachelors end up going for a masters/PhD because thats usually the requirement for any job as an economist. The United States has a diverse subset of political jobs that would take Econ degrees.  Second, how much do you care about money? With an economics degree, you will very likely make less than with a computer science degree. If you're more interested in econ than CS and money doesnt matter as much to you, then go ahead with econ."

I found the IT industry was great for unstructured self teaching because it's mostly ticket qualifications which aren't to expensive. But I ran into the problem of being qualified but having no experience and like hell of I wanted to intern for years so I decided to get experience by joining the military. Now I'm getting paid to train on military IT systems. So not only do I get paid training but by the end of my contract I'll have 5 year's of IT experience. it's also opened me up to other areas of the field so if I specialize as a line man I can climb cell phone towers and travel alot amoung other things. Now joining the army.. not for everyone.  If I could say anything about self teaching in the civilian world it would be that you are responsible for the aggregation of knowledge. This is good because you pick what you learn but bad because you may learn advance courses before learning the basics or you might not now subjects exist at all. Your education is also very bias to things that interest you which may be to the detriment of your future employer. a structured college setting avoids this unless it's a bad course."

The best advice would that the industry is heavily favored towards extroverts, since a huge part of how jobs are given are basically from networking. If you enjoy talking to people and are super passionate about film, this can actually be a really great thing! The 2 ways to break in are becoming an extra to meet people on film sets and to find PAing gigs, where you often don't need as much experience, and can observe what it's like working on a film set to gain experience and connections."

There are some schools that offer degree programs (bachelor's, master's, etc.) in occupational safety. There are also certificates for varying levels offered by the Board of Certified Safety Professionals (BCSP). You can also look into your regional OSHA office to see if they offer training or courses near you for OSHA-specific training.   The majority of people in this field, however, get started in a job to get experience and then earn these certifications or degrees. It depends on the field you're interested in, but you could look for entry-level positions in the construction industry, warehouses/distribution centers, or other places that may need to follow federal regulations.

Plus this will help get in the grove of answer the common interview questions that you are likely to receive.  Congrats, you made it past round 1.    Check out my post on common questions during various stages:   [My Experience From Job Hunting](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gt144v/my_experience_from_job_hunting/)   A couple of other thoughts that I had:  * You can always take the job, and keep looking for a new place while employed (getting paid and health insurance benefits) * I know absolutely nothing about UX jobs, but you said they are getting harder to get.  Why pass on an opportunity that has been presented to you?   * Is it just the hours that is making you not want the job, not interacting with anyone in the office or is it something else?    * If its just the hours, again not knowing your personal situation, I would not view this as an obstacle.    * Is it not interacting with anyone in the office:       * do you want to be in a office talking / working with others?       * Is it the commute?       * Is it concerns about the corona virus? * Is it pay / salary?    * again, tricky one with high unemployment.  You can always take it, and keep looking for a new gig.  You can explain that you are looking for a new place since it is a shorter commute, better benefits, etc... * Did you pick up on a possible toxic work environment? Unrealistic workload / time deadlines, etc?    * This is the trickiest one.  I always advise people to avoid a toxic work environment as it will demotivate you, which then typically leads to the quality of your work slipping.  Not to mention the anguish this can cause mentally on you at work and at home.       * Just during the time we are in with unemployment around 20%, this makes it harder to just give a blanked statement of pass on this job since its toxic.  I would take the interview.  I would personally during this time, accept the job since you can always keep looking.  You can always explain an extremely short duration at a job by saying:  * Once I got into the position, I realized that the opportunity was not going to be a good fit for me.  The daily responsibilities and hours were different from what I was told that I would be doing during my interview.  The working environment and culture were completely different than what was presented to me during the interview.  I would like to leave it at that to be polite.    * remember, don't bad mouth a past employer to a future employer.  This response will typically cease all inquiries from HR recruiters since they do not want to push you into bad mouthing an employee or getting into a potential grey area.    * be prepared though after this response to talk about the hours and culture that you would work best in or are looking to work in  Again, I don't know your personal situation, but I would point out that the Federal Unemployment of $600 ends at the end of July unless it gets extended."

They will have a better feel for whether that position will be opening up in the next few weeks/months. Lots of times it depends on departmental politics, and HR isn't always in the loop on that.   Sometimes hiring freezes end but new job reqs are dropped or go to the bottom of the pile - and by the time they open back up again, it might be a whole new team doing the hiring.   That said, if this was a vital role and the manager had enough flexibility and authority to immediately offer her several grand above the advertised rate, I think there's still a good chance they still try to offer it to her.   They needed someone in that role a few months ago.  They'll probably still need someone when this all blows over."

And i used  the the time in quarantine to take some personality and interest career tests.  O*Net is a good one to start with.  This will open other potential careers titles that you can search for, the best part is that they have separate lists for different levels of education.  I made a list of job titles that interest me, started searching job boards for them and reading all their postings and gradually compiling the skills, qualities and education they were looking for and keeping track of how they word things.  I then narrowed down on the titles or field that i thought i would do well and was capable of preparing for.  Then I sat down and wrote out all.my jobs, all my responsibilities --expanded resume, then googled all the hot key words that recruiters are looking for and how to reword to sound active and how my work reflected that skill. Rewrote my resume and cover letter. I then started looking at various certification programs and the price for jobs that needed more training while i was applying for one's that didnt require certs.  I found that cert programs are often cheaper than a degree.  I don't know you and don't know what the work of strip clubs entail, and I'm guessing you're okay with late nights, so that means you are mentally and physically capable of second and third shift.(They generally pay more)  You are able to multitask or prioritize tasks because you are dealing with loud high energy fast pace people and space.  You are very self aware, you know how to work as a team,  you value safety,  you able to quickly respond to situations, and you probably have great communication skills.  From retail, you have developing customer rapport, understanding customer needs, point of sales experience, teamwork, prioritising , understand chain of command, and maybe creating sale displays.  And the country is slowly reopening. Keep job boards on your phone,  indeed,  glassdoor, linked in.  And you can also spend the time creating a more professional social media personality.  Go through your Facebook, Twitter etc create a Linkedin There are lots of job coaches on youtube too that you listen to.

These is a bona fide occupational qualification.  Can you practice safety in the work place?  Asking questions about health directly can lead to a disability claim very quickly if not asked properly.  Employers can ask if you are able to complete the required task. In your case:  * legal question:  are you able to wear a mask for 8 hours? or stated differently, the position requires you to wear a mask for 8 hours. Are you able to do this?  This position will require you to get up every thirty minutes to clean the reception area.  This may include reaching up, bending down, etc.  Are you able to do this? * illegal question:  Are you allergic to materials masks are made from?  Do you have sensitive skin that would prevent you from wearing a mask? Do you have a bad back that would prevent from bending down to clean?  For example, if you are interviewing to be a security guard:  * legal question:  in this role, you will be required to stand up for 8 hours at at time.  Are you able to do this?

And if not, then the company has two options:     1. cut your salary to $69,999 (but a more round number like a 20% cut is more the norm, however it alters employment contracts and can leave a company open to labour board appeals), or   2. cut the position, and disperse the job to people who are earning $40,000, and have that $30,000 gap make up for not only the losses encumbered from your salary, but also the efficiencies you generate (ie: are you generating $70,000 salary equivalent + $30,000 efficiency equivalent / year = $100,000 per year generated by you for the company?)  When the going gets tough, and if it's no longer clear, and if they're not convinced you are generating more than they spend on you, then layoffs happen.  And it's a lot tougher to justify efficient work habits and behaviours when customer revenu drops more than the efficiencies you deliver.

You shouldn’t feel like you’re failing to secure an internship this summer because they are so few and far between nowadays. If you do get an opportunity to intern then you are really fortunate. I know many companies have rescinded offers to my friends because they can’t justify hiring interns when they’re cutting their workforce. I consider myself lucky to still have an internship this summer, but it’s nothing like what I signed up for- shortened to 4 weeks virtually.   Future employers will understand if you weren’t able to get an internship this summer, so don’t worry if it means you have to take on a different job."

My job has little growth opportunity and I had been feeling trapped for a few months before I started looking at new jobs.  Things have gotten worse with the coronavirus and WFH situation, with the company adding on way more responsibilities due to the increased disorder and frenzy. I receive messages and calls at all hours of the day. It’s gotten out of hand and the “trapped” feeling is just magnified.   I have tried working on solutions with my supervisor but the attempts so far have done very little to ease the workload and expectations.  I usually take pride in my work and have a fear of underperforming, so I tend to forget that a job is just a transaction. I dont know if you feel the same way but I hope it helps you out to remember that you won’t stay in this role forever, and in the meantime just go through the motions of your job and find something you like to do to ease your stress when your day is done. For me it’s been Animal Crossing and reality TV haha.   In the end, since the volume is high and it’s out of your control, and it’s a job you are looking to leave in the future, do you care about your performance? For me, trying to let that part go (caring about doing well) has helped.  Edit: just wanted to add another comment on what you said about being lucky to have a job right now. I understand that feeling and the guilt associated with wanting to leave. There’s nothing wrong with feeling upset about a job that you hate, no matter what the situation is. If it’s mentally taxing and affecting your health, it’s a valid concern."

Remember that the economy will not just totally open overnight and we still have a ways to go even though we are seeing glimmers of hope.  Given the current work from home rules most companies have had to implement, if you do get an offer from the new place, you could accept and test it out since I assume it would be remote. I actually just did that as I started a position before covid but had still been interviewing at another place for a job I REALLY wanted. I got the second offer and took it since all work was remote. I’m so glad I did because I love the new job and I’m taking a bit of a pay cut, but not only to I like the position and company more, their future outlook is much less risky in my opinion due to their industry.   The other company understood when I let them know, and I wasn’t even on furlough. I think all companies understand you have to look out for yourself right now and just being open and honest and even leaving it up for discussion when things open up, you will be fine.  One thing is I wouldn’t push to hRd for a higher starting rate rn. Don’t be taken advantage of,  but even companies benefitting from covid are in a weird place and unchRtd territory, so cash flow is crucial. I’d push more for a raise at 90 days after review to help balance that."

I provided a very honest reply that adequately stated that this did occur, and my acceptance of responsibility, as well as any steps taken afterwards (MADD meetings, alcohol awareness meetings) and was very clear that this was not indicative of my character and personality. I didn’t go into details of the actual DUI, recounting the events, or anything like that, and certainly didn’t make any excuses.

They hired you from another continent, that's the very first context you need to realise. Hiring like this is extremely expensive and risky for them, and does not happen usually except in cases one needs a specialist that can't be found locally. Even though Amazon is a global company it very much will want to keep hiring locally to the office you're meant to be at, because everything else is a logistical mess. So what this tells me is that you were meant to have some skill or background that was hard to get.  The fact that you kept bringing up lack of training and support doesn't chide well with the fact that you were hired for some specific skills you were meant to have. Yes there is usually a ramp-up period for newcomers, but generally this happens within the first month and by the third month one should already be working productively 80% of the time.   Things blowing up and you going to HR complaining about lack of training could very well just seem that you were not possessing the skills that they expected you to have when they hired you. They expected somebody to come on board and be able to work productively, not still require training after several months.   Over the ensuing threads you made and the panic you're in right now, it seems you hadn't fully realised this possibility and what exactly a probation period actually means. Especially in a European country like you're in right now, one does not consider a job to be secure until the probation period is over - it's one line of defence companies have against bad hires as past that it's extremely hard or very expensive to fire somebody without grave reason (Benefits you are getting is paid by the company).  Reclaiming relocation expenses and bonuses is standard practice in *any* company essentially anywhere. You will not find any job that gives out a bag of cash without having assurances they'll be keeping the hire for a long time and get a return on their investments."

They bill Verizon like $50 an hour for your work, they pay you like $25-30, spend some amount on payroll tax and benefits (they do give PTO and normal benefit stuffs I think) and pocket the rest.  I'd avoid going through them unless you are certain you can't land a job directly, at say Verizon yourself.  On the plus side, if you're someone that are unable to step into the field this is an easy way in. After a year or 2 you have exp on your resume and job search become incredibly more easy.  All in all, it's not a scam, but it's not a super great job comparing to normal software developer job because they take a cut and benefits are general worse than the actual company (Verizon or w.e) benefits.  However for people that are working in minimum wage or retails and want to jump to a new career I suppose it's a way.   Weight your options carefully"

Also updating them before hand on the situation will be useful saying that delays may occur due to prexisting projects taking priority (or whatever corporate BS you can come up with that isn't, \"no one is getting off their ass and doing any work\").   I would see if you can get a list of outcomes that your clients senior management wants from your company, and has been sent to your company.

It'll pay off in the end.\" A lot of recent graduates complain about tech support jobs, but depending on the environment (where tech support sometimes becomes borderline applications support/software development) that experience can shoot you into the division you want to be working for. A friend of mine who was tech support for a hospital was able to use the cross-job skills he acquired there to get a software development position at a different company. Cross-job skills are important for new graduates and to not emphasize them on cover letters/resumes/CVs is terrible.

Most of us are at one of these two stages:  >1988 $11,340 Unemployment, temp jobs, depression 1989 $23,308 Moved to city I didn't want to live in, but grateful for the opportunity.  Did you want to be patronized or talked to like a child when you were depressed? I've studied in four cities in three countries, and I did an internship at a factory in China.  I'm now in Europe and almost all large companies now want to enter the Chinese market. Sounds great, right? The problem is that it is impossible to get in touch with them. The only time I've heard back it's been \"we'll be in touch\" or \"you don't have enough experience.\" Certainly there must be plenty of people who'd want to hire me (I have a STEM/business dual degree too), I just can't get in touch with them or find out where they are. I make my CV and cover letter as a website and send it to companies on Twitter in response when they announce job openings but they don't even look at it.  If you're really in business and have a somewhat senior position you should educate yourself about how the economy works and how a digital business works.  First of all, we are in a global recession due to completely mismanaged monetary policy, which results in money flowing to the top - away from production, manufacturing and entry-level jobs which are cut or replaced with internships, to finance and venture capital who in turn invest in Silicon Valley startups. THIS is why WhatsApp is \"worth\" 19B.  The secondary consequence of this is an environment where labor is abundant while jobs are scarce, meaning employers pay very little and offer no security and won't train employees as that is also a cost. Since nobody wants to train, it is close to impossible to gain experience and skills needed to get a job.   -----  Since you know what it's like to be young and in a shitty situation and are now in a position of relative authority/power, why don't you read up about the realities of the job market and the recruiting process, which is completely failed, and make your company change your recruiting - maybe you can start recruiting right here on reddit?

All we know is that he just likes to hire people who play along, and answer the question based on some (not most or all) people's interpretation of this question.   I did like how he attempted to deter faked responses by establishing the nature of the assessment from the start. The wording, if that's how he actually presents it, was still a bit crude - it still conveys the notion that he's just added another layer of deception to the game. It's actually more effective to just administer questions/problems that can be measured objectively, tell his candidates to follow the guided directions, and to respond honestly (which has shown to reduce faking in job applicants)."

I see that you'll look at Facebook profiles as well.

So without having a solid foundation of what to look for, and with the limited time and resources, why is looking at social media website an assessment criteria in this case?  2. Looking for smiles, a certain way of dressing, how friendly/polite they approach you seem to serve the purpose of making *you* feel special. This sounds like a form of impression management, the dangers of which I am sure you are familiar with. Perhaps you can further explain how these trivial physical behaviors can account for variances in job performance/satisfaction/needs of the organization? If I'm a job fair attendee, I'm going to focus on seeking out the companies more than cracking a smile. After a long day at the fair, I'm going to have a lot of pamphlets and documents and brochures to lug around. If I see that the booth is empty, I'm going to stay for more than two minutes to really have a conversation with the recruiter. Are you saying that even though I'm qualified for the job (KSAs, competencies, and organizational fit), you would not consider me if I perform these actions?  3. If the purpose of the job fair is to connect potential applicants with the organization, and for the organization to show a presence for applicants to consider, why is there such a strict list of criteria on whether or not they are *allowed* to further explore the company with us? From the way it was written, it sounds like we all have a checklist to mark off when someone comes to talk to us; and if they don't meet enough of our criteria, they can't work at the company. Even you said it yourself, it seems like it's more of a game than trying to make honest connections with potential applicants."

As a trained hiring professional, I would agree that a Web Developer is certainly a very different position from Help Desk. However, I also know that they still share a lot of core job competencies that allow them to function and maneuver between those jobs, so the way to *hire* them is not all that different. I wonder, IF two jobs are so irrelevant even within its own field, why would people even want to attempt to give out advice in generality? Knowing that whatever is written can only be applied to this one instance for one position.  I hope you don't take it as an offense to what you're trying to accomplish, but I have not found the answer to this day when all of us are seeing this surge of people who want to give advice because they have held a lot of interviews. I've seen \"job gurus\" who want to charge money for this service, which makes it all the more hypocritical."

The scope of the writing is still too narrowly focused on the applicants, and almost none on the employer. Sure, as an applicant, I shouldn't drone endlessly or use vague buzzwords. But, as the employer, I should be able to build and guide the interview in a way that I won't just get drivels."

These behaviors only skim the surface and brings very little valuable data when it comes to performance assessment and prediction. Forget that the article tries to establish credibility by using the term \"hiring managers\" in the introduction. Most of the hiring managers these days are poorly trained in this subject area, so I wasn't surprised that they used pseudoscientific psycho-babble to justify these items.  We can also apply this list to how *interviewers* can make or break the interview they designed, since I've seen job-fillers violate almost every single thing on that list. It's very arrogant to say that, for example, applicants will ruin their chance if they miss little details, but it's okay if interviewers don't even read your resume before entering the room sometimes."

For positions not covered by DOT or safety sensitive requirements, most employers drug test during the pre-employment phase and for reasonable suspicion. If you fall under DOT (IT work does not), random testing protocols are required. Some employers test if you change jobs within the same company. Not many employers test periodically. Periodic testing is prohibited in some states. Cannabis testing rules for employment are in flux, with a slow but steady national trend toward increased restrictions. Google pre-employment drug testing requirements by state to find current status. See if you can find a copy of Amazon's policy. You will see state laws vary between no testing allowed, to test whenever you want, to test following federal guidelines. If you are in New York, you will be pleased to know Cannabis testing for pre-employment was recently banned. Best of luck."

Think of what everyone in the company gets paid for a day. The total accrued vacation liability falls by the total amount of what everyone gets paid for that day.  On an overall level that will make the company much stronger financially. That will make it easier for your company to get financing or to get better rates on their financing.

The reality is that Employee Selection is a critical part of organizational development, so it doesn't make sense for a company to not have the wherewithal to handle it, or believe they will always do it badly. It's like avid marathon runners outsourcing their shoe-tying to somebody else, because they don't have the time to do it themselves or believe they wouldn't tie a knot well. If they want to run, this is one of the basic things they need to do.  The problem is that companies didn't equip themselves with an HR that contained knowledgeable professionals who were trained to do hiring. Selection is totally a part of HR's wheelhouse, but most of the field is still comprised of old guards who got the position by being nice and know how to handle a payroll spreadsheet; and they gatekeep professionals from entering through arbitrary networking tactics. Companies could've easily onboarded someone with an HRM or related degrees, maybe certified, but definitely have expertise in organizational development; but they are stymied by the current HR Manager/Generalists who believe they won't be able to do the job effectively because reasons.  At the very least, the company doesn't have executive leadership that are well-versed enough about this. So they have no idea any of this is happening. Then, the only conclusion is to outsource their recruitment and selection efforts to third-party vendors like Staffing Agencies and Recruitment Firms, believing they are getting a 1:1 replacement with a talent acquisition professional. Like many comments have mentioned, these companies are ironically bleeding money because these firms aren't using sound methodologies to hire effectively, and they're sacrificing an already limited budget or competitive compensation because these agencies need to take their cut from somewhere."

If a company or small business treats you well, Pays you what you are worth and makes an effort to make their employees lives even a little bit better then you can place your loyalty not in the company but in those around you. If your boss is a great guy, Gives you all the opportunity he can provide, Understands day to day problems that sometimes require absence from work and so on. Then you can place your loyalty in him.  &#x200B;  Companies are not built for employees happiness. They are built to exploit people for profit. This model has worked well over time but at the cost of quality of life.  Being so young I would give this advice I give every youngster. Speaking from experience. I hate my work life and am actively trying to replace it. I just wish i realised all these things sooner.  * If you working harder than what you are being paid for. You are losing money. * If you feel like you are being exploited then you probably are. * Working harder than those around you won't do you many favours in the long run. * Work requiring low skill or just an able body is never rewarded well. * Loyalty placed in companies is misplaced * If there is little room to move up the chain, Don't exert more energy than needed. * You will always hate your job after a while and dread coming into work. * Use your free time wisely, Don't waste your youth working 40 hour weeks for little reward * Retail is a horrible industry * Ask for a pay rise when you want it. Don't be a pushover, More money does not come without asking. * Working diligently to make someone else more money that they pay you is an exercise in futility and should be limited. * Look at starting a business. * Picking a career immediately puts a hard cap on your potential earnings. You will only ever be paid so much. * Business has a no real cap on potential earnings. * Depending on your personality type you may find structured organisations relentless and disheartening. * Anyone who tells you they enjoy their job and isn't a marine biologist or doing some other cool shit is lying to you and themselves. * There are better jobs out there. None of witch will fulfil you, most of them are horrible grinds design to squeeze the life out of you. * Don't take your boss to seriously.  Advice from an IT manager. But I am also a fucking retard. You will encounter people like me often.  I have interviewed kids for service desk and dev ops roles, I can see they are eager and keen, It breaks my heart when after hiring one they become a drone right in front of my eyes.  &#x200B;  Start a business mate, Don't end up like the rest of us.  If someone says they like their mediocre job. They are lying and want you to experience the same pain they are.  Did I forget to mention, the higher you are paid the worse life gets and the less time you have? This is the rule for employment, There are exceptions but you are not likely to be one of them. Higher pay does not mean better quality of life. I know from experience. Being on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week is not worth the money.  Start a business. Its not easy but its not harder than people make it out to be."

If you use any kind of VPN or a Citrix login, oh yeah they are watching you. If it's your own device and they joined you to the network, they can see your browsing history while you are using their internet **and** copy data from your local computer back to their storage. So if you are bringing your personal laptop , your personal files are not secure.   Most companies I know of do not actually use tracking software: they manage permissions from  the hardware firewall (blocking Facebook or 18+ websites), disabling the admin rights to access storage drives or to save files. The firewall itself is the monitoring device and it keeps a log of websites visited amongst other things. So you aren't likely to have your HR team bust down the door while one is actually  watching Pornhub, they review the logs and pull you into a meeting 24-48 hrs later.... I hope that helps.

If you study another 15-20 hours a week, you'll still have time to work 40 hours, but you won't have a lot of time for the social aspect of college.  That's o.k., as long as you understand it going in.  What you really need to think about is how long it's going to take you to graduate.  With only 12 credits a semester, you'll most likely not graduate in 4 years.  This means you'll have additional tuition payments to make.       It sounds like you're a good student.  Are AP classes an option?  Or do you have the option of taking classes at a community college right now to earn HS and college credits simultaneously?  The more you can do to earn some of your college credits now, the better off you are."

I also care for my client (companies) and I know this sounds like a pollyanna thing but the biggest reward is matching people to companies and they stay there.  All my matches are team efforts, which means the candidates need to do their homework on what they want--salaries, corp. culture and location as well as the specific job.  Then we get to work and see what is out there.  Since I don't work on commission, my greatest reward is seeing someone land the job and my disappointment is when a great candidate misses out on an opportunity.   I am moving more into business developemnt because frankly recruiting is emotionally draining, difficult and I (and probably many recruiters) take rejections too personally, which over time can be debilitating.  They say don't take your work home, but that's hard to do when you know about dire financial situations.  When you care, recruiting is truly a 24 hour job.

Do your best to prepare them, but don’t worry about what happens to the tasks once your time is done, you don’t owe your employer anything else and you can walk away proud knowing you did what you could.  When you have spare time over the next two weeks, beef up your resume, gather information on your current role and accomplishments, touch base with coworkers and ask for help with your job search. Some employers will offer outplacement services through an employee assistance program - ask HR for any help.  When the two weeks is up don’t be hard on yourself, treat the job search like it’s your new job until you find something you want to do and take advantage of unemployment and any other services you can find - never be afraid to ask for help.

It has taken me about 6-7 years to get to this point though. Just hustle, try not to bring college up, learn as much as you can prior to the interview about the company, the skills required, technical knowledge required, and learn about the people you are interviewing with so you can try to have a good conversational interview with an understanding of their backgrounds too. DM me if you need help or advice. If you feel confident you can do the role, try not to use “quick learner” or “eager” or “hard working”, let that come through in your answers, use the STAR (situation, task, action, result..impact for bonus points) method to answer questions in an organized, clear, concise way.  Also, here is a resource spreadsheet myself and a couple others created and that will continue to get updated as much as possible. There are tabs for unemployment resources, job sites, charities/emergency funds, online communities, and more.

Life goes on, we have a living we have to sustain, and the one person we need to have the best interest out for is *ourselves*. This pandemic is perfect example that there are companies out there that will drop you in an instant to save themselves.  As much as companies are adamant about saying they want to hire their workforce back after this pandemic clears, you have to remember ***nothing is guaranteed unless it is in a signed and acknowledged contract***. Unless your separation papers from the company states there is a specific month/date you are due to be hired back on or even talks about a promise of being brought back on, you need to realize you are 100% done with that company. You are not legally tied and employed by that company anymore so you are not obligated to act any particular way toward them.  In the meantime start updating your resume and looking for opportunities (while also following your state's orders during this pandemic of course) You can begin your search on LinkedIn without having to blatantly advertise you are 'seeking new opportunities' (there are features on there where you can turn off updates to your network if you have to update/edit anything)  Once this pandemic is done, I think a lot of people are going to get burned by empty promises from their former employers if in the event they can't hire 100% of their original workforce back."

If you do your job correctly, then she has nothing to say about you unless it directly involves her. And you as a person are going to, maturely, make this big:  \\- Trust: You as a person have been insulted and won't undergo this. You are going to exploit this as hard as possible, let the company know that trust for you is a serious requisite and this damages any future involvement with the colleague.  \\- 'Knowing your place:' She doesn't have much direct involvement with you but does complaint about you. Ask her what the direct cause was of this. She's gonna have to answer with 'Well in the last 3 weeks we worked on...', if she can't describe an actual situation causing this complaint then she's... well she's fucked.

It's easy to be bitter but it's generally not personal just business.  Interviews I have had after these experiences, when I have been unemployed, most interviewers didn't even ask about it."

I posted on FB and had a lot of people looking out for me and networking for me. My last day was June 21st and I start my new job tomorrow. A few things I realized. Even if you don’t think you qualify, apply anyways. I paid somebody to spruce up my resume and I had lots of positive feedback about it. I bought two new suits and I think that helped me feel like a million bucks in interviews.  There is no such thing as overselling your qualities. If you are good at something, you are very good at it. Odds are, you’re going to have to take a pay cut, so make sure you get hired at a company that has good promotion opportunities. I switched my mindset from how much am I going to make, to how much can I save for retirement. And...I took some time to mourn the loss of my good job.

A food related job no body really cares about, and once you figure out freelancing you won't even need a resume anymore so I wouldn't worry about. (I freelance as a book illustrator, do my clients care I used to work in retail? No, why would they?) You will need to take jobs to stay a float, no shame in that, just keep building up your portfolio and find other people with interests like yourself, often they will be both your support and perhaps future clients. You will need to put yourself out there and offer value to people, then people will start to trust you and help support you as best they can. Go to meetups, say yes to opportunities, and say thank you and keep going. It's a really hard road, but it gets a little easier with time.     It took me a year to get out of retail and I'm still not that super stable with 5 clients I've had for months. I'd recommend saving up as much as you can before starting freelancing because it's hard to make money freelancing but it's possible, just need to wear a lot of hats, and be very comfortable with high risk, you are running a business and it's easy to find it overwhelming sometimes, but my schedule is so flexible it feels really worth it. I can offer you some advice on marketing and social media, and work with you to present yourself a little better if you like. I don't have a degree in art, so you already are a step up on certain job positions. I don't have a lot of time but I can offer a little if you are serious about freelancing, for free even."

On the low, I referred him to the labor division who filed a complaint that he was fired for discussing wages. Basically it was an open and shut case as multiple people witnessed it and were fully cooperating with the investigation.  The company offered him either his job back or something like $20,000. Incredibly, he took his job back. I guess he thought he would be retaliated against and could pursue this further, well he was wrong.

We call this working proactively. So, if you are in a work environment and you see a risk, or a threat, you should proactively put some control/measure in place to prevent it.   Now, here is the interesting part \\- and this is KEY. It is not enough to just prevent. You have to articulate what you did and why to your boss. Otherwise, he/she won't know. The reason s/he won't know is b/c you are playing defense. Defensive players never get the glory and are only given attention when things go wrong.

In terms of writing a resume, when I was younger I used websites where you insert the info and it makes up a resume for you and found that was a good place to start because it gives you good examples of relevant information to put via a dropdown menu. You can google \"fast food restaurant resumes\" to get a good idea of what to put - because your young and probably don't have the experience, focus on the skills section. Fast food and retail places usually just want someone punctual, reliable and hardworking. Apply to MANY places. They definitely don't mind if you don't have experience but you will usually get one interview every 30 applications or so regardless. Try using keywords from the job posting in your resume. I started applying for jobs when I was 15 but didn't get one until I turned 16, so don't be discouraged."

Working with family blurs lines - I can't speak to what your relationship with your dad is like, but there's a risk that your arguments with your father at home might look similar in the workplace. Some things exchanged between the two of you might not fly if he wasn't your dad.   2. Possibility of stunted professionalism -  Being able to be sociable with strangers, clients and coworkers, and learning to work in a team with your coworkers (even the ones you don't like) is incredibly valuable. I would worry about not being properly socialized if your only team mate is your dad.   Is money a big issue for you? If it is, I'd say definitely the firm.   Would it be possible for you to join in at a later stage of his startup? Or join occasionally as a \"consultant\"? Or if you end up hating the firm, could you go back to your dads startup as a fallback?"

I think knowing the kind person your boss is will be extremely helpful in starting these kinds of conversations.  For example, if you believe your boss manipulated you to work for less than 12-13 dollars, chances are you're not going to get the raise.  But if you believe your boss is a fair/understanding person, I think its very important to ask him to talk about salary. Every boss I have had that's worth a damn has listened very closely to my concerns about compensation.  When/if you do have the chance to speak to your boss, I think its very important to **NOT** focus on the fact he promised you that amount 3 months ago. Chances are he won't even remember. It can turn into a \"he said, she said\" argument that you won't win. If its not written down in paper, it didn't happen.   I'm not saying that you should pretend that conversation never happened. Rather, I would shift the focal point to something to this: Explain to your boss why you deserve a raise. Convince him that the quality of work you are outputting warrants that extra pay.   If you can't think of anything, maybe its time to start to document things you have done in the 3 month span that demonstrates your value to the company.  If he brushes you off or tries to ignore the topic of a raise, then unfortunately you have a tough decision to make. Either stay and make less, or leave for a company that pays you your desired amount.  I wish you the best of luck!"

First of all, I definitely understand the struggle as I did not find it easy either and like you, I volunteered at several places and I stuggled securing interviews.  Now, there are few things you might be doing wrong.    1. NHS vs Private Searching through Indeed tells me you've mainly looked for private jobs, but most clinics want to hire someone with at least 2 years of experience. This might sound like the easier option but I'd suggest mostly focusing on securing and NHS post first to gain some experience and quality  training.   2. UP THAT SUPPORTING STATEMENT!!  This is the one element I found made all the difference for me - this is what secures you an interview. A lot of people don't want to feel like bragging and they might overlook things that would sell you to the interviewer because you've assumed they are normal (Such as managing your independent ward etc). They often are not. You did amazingly well on your last placement? Let them know! You had a really niche research done at uni? Let them know why you chose it - it tells them you're passionate about the profession! Don't be shy in using words like \"outstanding\" and \"excellent\" in relation to the quality of your work. If you don't convince them you're the best possible asset to them, then someone else will. Recruiters will also think \"if they are so insecure about their skills, then why would we be\"? Also, ask a friend to look at it, even if they aren't PT. After my boyfriend (studying 3d animation) helped me tighten my SS , I got asked for 5 interviews of the 7 jobs I applied for.   3. Have patience.  It's easy to get discouraged after you don't hear back. Persist and work on your application.  Good luck!"

So, we didn't have to deal with the typical admin/legal/accounting side of the equation (my mentor precisely took this opportunity to escape those challenges in running his own \"one-man\" consulting firm), yet we were placed into a sink-or-swim situation with regard to getting the department off the ground; either we became revenue neutral by year end or we probably weren't going to remain a part of the company.  The biggest thing we had walking into that situation was we already had clients lined up to avail themselves of our services so we could begin bringing in money as we developed more business in the meantime.  Similar to starting your own business, we learned quickly that starting our own department meant that we only had ourselves to do the work.  We couldn't afford staff to do the dirty stuff, so if a client needed us on-site tomorrow to dig holes and measure stuff, we were on a plane ourselves to do it.  We didn't have templates for reports, manuals for standard procedures, or software created to meet our needs, so we had to create, develop, and buy every bit of it.  We probably worked 80-100 hours a week in those first few months getting the foundation laid for our department.  We're at Year Two now and only now have things started to settle down as we have managed to find, train, and maintain staff to perform some of our operations for us.  However, there are still plenty of times where my boss or I have to do things personally because of the particular niche in which we work; we don't get the luxury of being too tired for anything because if we don't do it, then it doesn't get done and no one gets paid.  I can only say that my boss and I are workaholics and do get quite a bit of satisfaction from the particular work we do.  It's not for everyone, and I will provide a word of caution that when you own a small business, you still have a boss to whom to answer.  It's just that your boss goes from a single manager or CEO to the client, and clients aren't always the fairest bosses.  Providing a service or product to paying customers often means compromising your own vision or view of how a particular service should be rendered or product should be developed in service of getting those customers to buy it.  You may think yellow wallpaper is ugly, but if your customers want it, then you are stuck choosing between your personal taste and your desire to put food on the table for yourself.  That's not to say you have to completely sell out, but the distinction between a job and a hobby lies precisely in the degree to which you are willing to adapt your individual perspective to meet the needs of consumers who may have a different perspective."

Don't stress out, cuz whoever gonna train you know that you are new and will be easy on you. Even the customers will be easy on you, just use the newbie card. Under normal circumstances, you will need to make small talks, but now better dont talk at all :))  Don't worry too much, there is no use worrying about it now.

But I highly doubt there is any engineer jobs that have paid training outside of the military. In terms of technology jobs in general, there isn't really any significant paid training outside of your training when you first get the job. They're usually only hiring people people who have some skill in their field whether through a degree or certificates.   If you're interested in non tech related fields, there's paid training in a lot of job fields that don't have a ton of movement upwards but are generally hurting for workers, usually labor intensive. The major trade jobs such as electrician, plumber, sheet metal, pipe fitter, etc, usually have apprenticeship programs you have to apply for. HVAC apprenticeships are usually just low level labor positions with HVAC companies, but they'll definitely train you. Any sort of job that has the title \"field service technician\" usually has extensive paid training.   The best option is engineering school. If you're smart enough to do it, it's pretty hard to be unemployed. Even if you can't find that sexy 60k entry level engineering job, whatever your field is, electrical, computer, mechanical, etc, there are companies that will hire you to do something. If you don't think you're smart enough to do engineering school, trade school is the best option. A lot of trades are in need of workers as over the last 10+ years people went to get professional degrees. But not only that, you can go to trade school for a 'non-trade' Such as IT, accounting, or something in the medical field. Trade schools are also usually pretty good at getting students lined up with jobs before they even graduate."

I do think that in some cases paying for the certificate is worth it and that is because it also unlocks *more features* in the course.  Some skills are hard to learn. When you pay for a certificate you also get access to more of the exams and you will have your assignments graded.  This **feedback** is often invaluable to see if you are making progress or just following the videos.  Another good way to decide if you want to invest the money is to think of how much *your time is worth*.  Think of the money as an **investment** against your time, it will help you stay motivated through the harder parts of the learning curve.  * If the course is 48 hours over 12 weeks then $75 might be a good idea * If you just want a quickie course then take the free option  Here is a longer break down of the edX [online certificates](https://www.theschoolbell.net/online-courses-with-certificates) if you are interested.

There are loads of jobs available in many different programming languages, it’s easy to use and they escrow the payments from clients so it’s safe.  My advice would be to set your rate pretty low to start with and make sure you nail the first jobs and get a good review as clients often look at your success score and if you can get top rated status you will get lots of people contacting you with opportunities. Once you’ve built up some good reviews you can increase your rate as you see fit. Also it is worth trying to build relationships and get done long term clients if you are looking to get steady work."

What school do you go to, do they have baja, solar car, SAE? I know you're civil versus mechE. 4. Is your career center not actively helping you find a coop? Other than providing resume reviews? 5. The art of interviewing is just sounding confident and practicing. You can do this in normal discourse, spend a little bit of time to think before you speak and make sure you articulate well - even on a colloquial basis, this will go far. 6. honestly, see if you can get any presentation opportunities in classes. this will help your interview prep. 7. If your school expects you to find your own co-op how have you been networking with your peers. Can you get a mentor in this co-op program and get help that way?  8. Network with other students and see if they can get you into a co-op."

Everybody leaves and, when you go into the kitchen, you see a mountain of dishes.   That mountain of dishes is this job that you just got.  But...how do you do this? There's a fuck tone of 'em!  You put them into piles.  Stack the plates over there and start gathering the bowls. Put the silverware in the sink to soak. Let's toss the pots and pans waaaaay over there... we'll do that last. Find a spot for all the cups and then evaluate.  Everything is still a mess...but it's an organized mess. Identify which one you want to do first and then do one pile at a time.  Those piles are the tasks you've identified that need doing. The silverware was tasks that aren't time sensitive and the pots and pans are big items that can be done later.  Pretty soon, all the dishes are done and you've got a clean kitchen (job).  Hope that helps!!"

Within each linked file are 3-4 resources.   1. the training module (i.e. excel sheet with data, explanation on what methodology is used to process that data, and calculation checks)  2. a tutorial video (I used OBS studio - it's free and seems to work well)  3. a notepad file that you add your initials to to check off that you've done it and also checked for errors (essentially acting as like a wiki of sorts)  4. any other relevant content  So, we've built this index, and now we're filling it up with content.  We're also going to record presentations from industry leaders and stuff like that to help pass on knowledge from company and industry veterans.  The idea is we're trying to make records of stuff that is known, and knowledge that has taken years to accumulate, then put it in an easily accessible structure, complete with full walkthroughs on how to actually *do* it.  So, we have, for example, field studies, tests, which generate data, so our breakdown (so far) is something like this:  * geotechnical -> subdirectory: analytics/field work/calculations      *geochemical -> lab testing/static/kinetic/field testing  *hydrogeology -> field tests/data handling/GW modelling  Etc. so each sub-directory has a new list, and you just keep drilling down until you find what you're looking for.  Hope that helps - eventually we'll replace the excel/VBA GUI with an actual app."

They are trying to see if you are affordable. They want to NOT insult you with a low offer. HR doesn't give a crap what you make. Their job is to make sure the hiring manager offers something reasonable.   If you want $170,000 and the job pays $80,000? They're going to look for other positions and opportunities for you.  I have TWICE this week gone to bat for people who made less than I thought they should in their current position and both have offers out for at least 20% raises from where they are (both not internal candidates.... they were both shocked... but I looked at what the market pays them and got them to a reasonable level for their skill set) One of them is getting an offer $30K OVER what the hiring manager wanted to offer.  Why? Because the Hiring manager has no idea how much this person SHOULD make and neither does the person who applied - who is grossly underpaid at their current position. (I thought she was going to cry when I told her the offer today)  Y'all think HR is the enemy. It's not an \"us VS them\" game. We are both pulling on the same side of the rope. You want a job. I want to give you a job. The hiring manager is the PITA who is in the way.  Good grief. Answer the FREAKING question!"

People fib on their resume and embellish all of the time, but every now and then you will be asked of your proficiency with skills you listed. I interviewed at a sports media company last year over the phone and the interviewer wanted to bring me in to test my CSS skills as I had listed it on my resume. Did I use CSS in my everyday? Yes, but not to the extent they wanted me to do so. Luckily I didn't have to do any hand coding, just observation and telling him what I saw. It didn't cost me the job as HR ultimately canceled the position, but I came away with a very important lesson.  You've somehow managed to skate by without getting tripped up and good for you, but your situation isn't a one size fits all. The advice you listed can be found on any Business Insider/Forbes careers related article and it isn't necessarily good advice especially #5. If anyone is just starting their career post-college, DO NOT follow what he said. That's how you develop bad habits and develop a piss poor reputation around the office especially among those who you're screwing over when you decide to show up late/leave early. I've worked with people like you so that's why it bothers me that you're advising others to follow your lead. This piece of advice alone says a lot about you and why you've been okay with essentially lying to get ahead."

Not the gigs themselves but the buildup to actually getting work and the aftermath when a job is over. It has been such a joy during the last few months to not have to worry about my weight, my hair color, competing against friends, losing out on jobs and not finding out why.  And with COVID, the opportunities are even fewer so competition is even greater. I have been working for a chiropractic college as a simulated patient for the interns the last couple of years (also an \"acting\" gig\") to supplement my on-camera income.

I don't know if job shadowing would have helped in my case, because graphic design (and other illustration/fine art related jobs) SEEM fun and cool, but no one really warns you about the downsides when you're a student -- little job security, tough competition, work being outsourced. There's also the fact that if you don't work for a design firm or in-house as a company graphic designer, then you pretty much have to freelance, and guess what, there's even less job security there. And, to succeed you have to be just as good at business, networking, and all that jazz as you are at the actual art/design.  It's not like we didn't visit countless design firms in my program (we did, and even went to NY to visit ad agencies and typography foundaries and the society of illustrators)... but somehow I guess I never realized that my personality and natural skillset did not fit these fields at all.  I almost screwed myself over trying to change careers, too... I jumped into a medical lab assistant program without really realizing that it would be 90% phlebotomy. Job shadowing really would have helped me there!! It's not the needles and blood that bothers me, it's the constant interaction with patients, a lot of whom are grumpy because they're fasting, or because they're sick, or scared of needles, or tired of waiting an hour for blood work... and so on. I'm an introvert and I tend to take on other people's emotions and it was extremely difficult to have so many different interactions with the public in one day.  Thankfully, my workplace has opportunities for lab assistants to work behind the scenes at the testing lab, receiving/sorting specimens and helping to set up cultures for the lab techs, and that's what I do now. No more interacting with the public. I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't been able to make that switch. I was seriously a basket case working as a phlebotomist, and I dreaded every day -- yet I couldn't change careers yet again because I'd exhausted all my sources of support. I'm so thankful I was able to make a lateral move like that.  Anyway.... I guess what I'm trying to say is that job shadowing can be useful at times but not in all situations! It really depends what kind of a headspace you're in, too. When I was younger I was much more willing to delude myself and gloss over troubling things about my proposed career. I was wearing rose-coloured glasses."

Not going into details on here, especially since I post on this subreddit with my other account. I wouldn't want people to identify who I am and know these sordid embarrassing details. But in my case, I not only ended up in a job I was overqualified for that I detest it, but it took years just to find that. Right after college, I struggled and was stuck working in retail. I ended up literally homeless because my parents reached a point where they said I was not able to stay at home anymore, and I didn't have enough money or credit to have my own place. Eventually when I got back on my feet, it was only because I worked 72 80-hour weeks in menial jobs such as at a restaurant and a warehouse. Just being able to climb from the Dirt 2 lower working class was a huge amount of hard work as it was. What's really pathetic is, my most recent job felt like a godsend to me, even though it was a job I was overqualified for that only required an associate's degree when I already had a bachelor's degree. After I started there, the job got worse. I got transferred to different times within five years. My job has multiple branch locations, so it's easy to short people around. Also, they stopped giving out any raises whatsoever as part of a salary freeze due to the government budget cuts. So for more than half the time I worked there, I received no raise in sight. The people that worked with seemed really cool and friendly when I first started, but over the years the people I worked with didn't seem so friendly. They seemed Katty and clicky. It reminded me of high school a little to be honest. That might also be because getting shifted around had me feeling like new girl complex at each different location, and the most recent location had a lot of older women who we're rather snooty towards me."

First world problems my god, I really feel spoiled now.  My advice to you would be this: We have the goals and aspirations, these are unfounded for the most part (we dont really know what the other side will be like until we are there). We can do our best to predict  and we might even get in our own heads to create a reality that isn't there or doesn't need to be but it's our responsibility to understand this and do what we can to really understand our situation and circumstances. You have the advantaged of leverage, use this and develop hobbies and or more education to go farther and do more.  We are often told school > job > retirement but it is SOO much more complex than that. School is only a couple years of your life, you still have so many more years ahead. The only way to find fulfillment is to keep moving forward and I absolutely hate that that's true but it is. Nobody is going to be happy being stagnated.  Keep going, you have it good compared to the majority of the world, use this to propel yourself beyond your current state and be EVEN better. This sounds a bit cheesy, but this is also coming from a cynic who used to contemplate suicide on a daily basis because I realized what you did but I didn't understand the purpose behind all of it which most people seldom tell you about - let alone know."

I am really the very worst prospective employee that you want to reject, seriously.  I have a set limit as to how many job rejections I can literally tolerate in a row.  Let's say the number is 15 sequential job rejections....  So with each job rejection I get, I always ask WHY I was rejected.  Now some people say that I'm not entitled to an answer, but I sorely beg to differ.  I was the one who took the time to get my resume ready for YOU, and I took the time to fill out your lengthy-ass application.  Therefore, you at least OWE me a detailed one or two-sentence explanation as to why you rejected me, and the explanation CANNOT be something like, \"We hired a candidate with better qualifications.\"  Well, WHAT qualifications does that person have that make him/her better than me?  I want to know so that I can actually GET those qualifications if I don't have them, know what I mean?  I also require an answer for a rejection because if I'm making a mistake, I will know NOT to make the same mistake for future applications I send out, and thus won't be wasting my damn time.  Following me so far?  Ok, good...the fun has yet to begin...  This is my standard operating procedure (SOP) for dealing with a job rejection.  Now in the early rejection phase (say, for the first 5 rejections in a row), I only email them back once asking why I was rejected.  Then when we get to the 6th through 10th rejection, I start getting more insistent...maybe 3 emails or so for each rejection.  THEN, when we get to the 11th through 15th sequential rejection, the anger starts building up to a grand crescendo, to the point of harassment actually.  I call them up, I leave voicemails, I send up to 10 emails asking for a legitimate explanation as to why exactly I was refused employment for the 13th time.  For the lucky 15th prospective employer who rejects me, that's the lucky winner!  They get a death threat, folks!  Yes!  A death threat!  (As you can tell, I am quite psychopathic, having experienced serious career trauma over the past 15 years...\\*hint\\* that's where my 15th job rejection limit comes from!)  Lord, when is that universal basic income going to become a reality so that at least your food and rent are covered at the bare minimum???  This would alleviate SO much anguish and potential death...seriously!!!!  To me, these job rejections are direct denials of my right to earn a living so that I can actually survive and thrive, so if you deny ME that, I'll sure as hell make sure that you don't have that right either.

That thing that makes them get out of bed every morning excited to face the day? Did they always know what it was or did they learn later in life?  First of all, your passion is not necessarily going to be what you do for a living. You can be great at your job even if it’s not what your passionate about. So let’s divide this exercise into two parts: FINDING YOUR PASSION and FINDING A JOB YOU ARE OK WITH AND THAT ENABLES YOU TO PURSUE YOUR PASSION.   Take a Deep Breath Before we begin we have to be aware that you’re going to feel some discomfort at some point during the exercise. Fear, insecurities, impostor syndrome, what ifs. That’s all normal because change is hard, you’ve probably been in your comfort zone of misery at your job or in your present lifestyle for a while and it’s hard to push yourself out of that comfort zone. For now, just ignore the discomfort. Later we’ll deal with your limits, how far you’re willing to venture out of the zone.  Next, turn off your NEGATIVE SELF-TALK. It’s going to want to say things like, “I could learn how to dance. I’ve always wanted to do that. But there’s no way I can become a dancer at my age!” or “I’ve always wanted to learn how to fly a plane. But it must be so hard. I don’t think I have the time. Plus it must be expensive.” Finding your passion is about taking action not about listening to that negative little voice in your head that keeps you paralized with fear and doubt. It’s not about practicalities right now. It’s about finding out what your passion is and whether your passion is going to be a part of your job or something you do outside of your work.  Steps to Your Passion Get a notebook and let's get started!  What would you be willing to do without getting paid? What can you do for hours without getting bored? How would you spend your time if money weren’t a problem? What do you love to talk about when you’re with friends? Who are you jealous of because of the job they have? Look back at your life and identify moments when you felt great.  What were you doing? What elements combined to make those moments great?  Have you considered that your passion may be something you haven’t tried yet?  If you’ve lived in your comfort zone for a long time, chances are you haven’t tried new things much. What things have you always wanted to try but haven’t yet?  Painting? Learning a language? Writing a book?  What things have you done that you’re proud of?  Close your eyes and imagine yourself 5 years in the future. What are you doing? What lifestyle are you living?  Time to Do Some Cooking Now, start combining hard skills, soft skills and the traits mentioned by the people who know you best.  Let’s imagine these are all ingredients and if we combine some of them, we can bake a cake, if we combine others, we can prepare a salad.  They’re not the same food, but they’re both delicious.  For example, I speak 3 languages + I’m diplomatic + I love to travel = I can be a foreign language teacher abroad. On the other hand, I’m organized + I’m a good writer + I love reading = I can become a freelance editor or copywriter.  As you can see, those are two very different jobs, yet we arrived at both of them combining my different skills.  Steps to Finding the Job You’re OK with As mentioned before, it may turn out that your passion is not your job and that's fine. That's true for most of us. But it's important to find work that doesn't make you miserable. So let's go back to the notebook!  List the jobs you definitely do not want to do or would even consider.  Make a list of your HARD skills. These are measurable abilities, school learned abilities such as writing, reading, math, using computer software.  Make a list of your SOFT skills. Traits such as etiquette, diplomacy, communication, listening, getting along with people.  Talk to your friends and family and ask them to (honestly!) describe your personality. Take notes.  What were you good at in school/college (it doesn’t matter if you liked it or not)? What have you been good at in the jobs you’ve had throughout your life? What matters to you the most when it comes to a career/job: The salary? The hours? The work environment? Doing something you excel at?  Your Passion Be flexible. A study by Stanford psychologists found that most people have the mistaken belief that a passion is something you find easy to do. When people pursued their passion and encountered challenges, they gave up. The researchers further studied mindsets about interests in an experiment where a group of students who identified as “techie” or “artsy” were given two articles to read, one tech related and the other related to the humanities.  Students who had a fixed mindset about their interests were less open to reading an article that was outside their area. Unfortunately, focusing one one area could prevent you from finding your passion, which could happen when you bring different fields together, when you see connections between fields that you might not have thought of before.  A Growth Mindset is More Likely to Lead to Your Passion In another experiment, researchers showed students an interesting video about the origin of the universe. Most students were fascinated. Then they were asked to read a challenging scientific article on the same topic. A lot of students lost their initial excitement and the ones whose enthusiasm for the topic dropped completely were those who had a fixed mindset about their interest. People who may be interested in a subject can change their mind when it becomes too challenging.  “Develop” Instead of “Find” Researchers concluded that “Developing your Passion” is more appropriate than “Finding Your Passion,” because development requires commitment, seeing things through even when they become difficult.  Another path to your passion can be developing valuable skills that will lead to greater career satisfaction because you’ll be financially stable and more likely to develop a passion for a field you’ve cultivated deep expertise in. In other words, first establish the lifestyle you want for yourself and then fit a career around your vision. First get your basic needs taken care of by creating a plan for your life and part of that plan is the development of your Passion.  Passion Still Requires Discipline But no matter which approach you choose to follow, you will never develop your passion if you keep switching directions and following every shiny object that crosses your path.  Even if they have a natural talent, ballet dancers invest years of discipline and hard work on their passion. So do athletes. So do millionaires. And so will YOU.  Now step back and look at the big picture. Is your passion something you can incorporate into your career/job?  Is it something you will be doing on your personal time, after you do your work at a job that is just FINE; it’s not your passion, but it allows you to live well and pursue your passion?"

Try to get as many cash jobs as you can. This is you starting to generate your own life prospects!  3) Keep applying for that dream job and the jobs that are step below that one!  4) Write a new cover letter for every job you apply to.  5) Have some HR people review your resume. The resume gets you in the door for an interview.  6) Review your interview skills and presentation. Again ask some HR people for tips. Always dress the part for the job you are interviewing for.  7) Volunteer for any non-profit organizations related to your career. These people can become good networking for insider job postings and references.  8) Build your professional social network like LinkedIn. As you connect to new people offer to help and never expect anything back. In time the right connections will surface to help you.  9) Start a blog or youtube channel based on your career. Wildlife is amazing! Start talking to your kids about wildlife and they will give you ideas for your blogs or videos. When recruiters and hiring managers see your blogs and videos they will see someone passionate for the industry. Your blog posts could be just part of LinkedIn if you don't have website skills."

I felt bad at the same time for her but didnt. She just made poor decisions. She wanted to go back to school and get another degree. (since it was free cuz of her status or something idk). I told her it was unnecessary but she stuck to her belief. Im not sure what happened with her though now. Last I heard she was moving to LA (were in NYC) after covid eases down.

Pooled our incomes to pay off loans and heavily invest (like 70% of our income) for about 3-4 years.  Less extreme investing once we got our own place together with no roommates.  Now coasting with dual income and planning to be financially independent in about 12 years, we would both be just shy of 40 years old.  We might be able to do it faster, but we're not pushing too hard on it and making sure to enjoy our lives.  The key was definitely leveraging our income heavily with investments as early as possible.  We can seriously invest like 5% of our income and retire well before most people because of this.  My income is roughly $93k after annual bonus after 5 years experience.   Wife's income is roughly $65k after 3 years experience.

If you were on track to become management, it's time to start acting like it. Fight fire with fire. Collect all the evidence you can, start having preliminary meetings with company leadership, lay the foundation for a tougher conversation down the road. If you communicate to the powers that be this woman is toxic to the work culture, there is a chance they will choose harmony over her bullshit. Even better if other people at the company can attest to her bs.  Document everything you can. Worse comes to worse, your fighting back spurs her to fire you and you get unemployment plus you have a paper trail proving you tried to communicate her issues with you to leadership numerous times."

It's worth it to take a little time to think about what you want to do, what kind of people you want to work with and in what setting.  There are a lot of books on this.    The Myers Briggs type tests can help give some insight so you could search on \"INFP careers\".   I think this site might also be helpful: [https://www.careerexplorer.com](https://www.careerexplorer.com).  My guess is you would be happier in things like social work / psychology / nonprofit than in finance / sales / marketing type jobs.  As for money, probably if you stuck with social media marketing or business technology you could make a lot of money, but that doesn't mean you would be poor in helping professions like psychology / social work / nonprofit.  I know several people who are social workers or therapists that do quite well for themselves.   For those positions you're going to need graduate degrees and probably licenses.  I also know people that have been involved in nonprofits or \"corporate giving\" positions that have good (though not spectacular) salaries.  Since you're still in school take advantage of any academic and career advisors who can help you find direction.  I didn't do that much, had no clear career plan, and when I graduated floundered around for years.  So don't make that mistake.  Get on it .  There's still time."

The other major downside is the pay, because one great thing of working in the US is the currency exchange in other countries.  **Startups:** This is one of my favorite ideas and I have never thought of doing this yet, I love the idea of being part of something small and making it grow. Dealing with the business behind it does excite me. This idea is really giving me passion to code and enjoy my studies again. Even if it the company does fail or go under I will still be able to get back on my feet fairly easy due to Software Engineers being needed.The one downside and the thing that makes me feel selfish for saying, is that I wouldn't be able to to just pickup and leave to another country when I wanted to.  I didn't fully mention the importance of leaving to a developing country. I want to live in one not only because I love the simplistic lifestyle, but I also because the money I would make here in the US goes much further. In a country such as Guatemala a 10k salary would be more than enough for a person to live comfortably and plane tickets are fairly inexpensive too. I feel that it is almost a loophole in life to use it as an economic advantage. I might get a little sting for saying something a bit selfish, but I've met many people from such countries that would travel to the USA to work then send money back home to their families then return after they had saved enough."

For facebook, I'm looking at thinks like how you communicate. Do you speak clear proper english? Do you speak in slang? Do you use punctuation and proper spelling?

Don't drink beer because that's classified as a depressant and will make things worse.  Mentally: Approach these events with a challenge mindset instead of a something you're afraid of. Be ready to take some losses and disappointments but don't let that be the focus. Instead, focus on how many positive exchanges you get. You only need 1 to be successful. You can do this by focusing on them not you! Small talk is not fake, it's a necessary little game for all of us to find out if someone is worth investing more into.   Good luck!

This pandemic is just the pin that has pricked the bubble that we call our economy. Its not the pandemic we have to worry about its the next depression.  This lockdown and fear of the pandemic is going to permanently change spend habits. People will start to spending less and saving more. Some people mistakenly think that a 401k is equivalent to saving. However they will soon realize that a 401k just a stock market casino where the investor always loss and 'they' always wins. Even with the recent stock market dip it has long way to fall. Life savings will as a result vanish. Also as customers start spending less and investors flee stocks, companies will start shutting down . Layoffs will increase while incomes and tax revenues decline.  A positive feedback loop will be created when enough unemployed stop spending money in other industries. This means more bankrupt businesses and more unemployment.    Governments are powerless. Since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008 the government have shot their last silver bullets. By lowered interest rates on loans to Zero in an attempt to stimulate economic activity for the last 10 years this has  allowed millions of people and businesses to get into massive amount of debt. This also has allowed the wealthy to stay in business to provide jobs for the poor so that they could feed their hungry children ( or do drugs) . But like drug addicts the economy IS addicted to these loans, because without it we will have to endure severe pain and suffering. A similar situation occured prior to the GFC where too many  un-credit worthy people and businesses got loans on homes they cant afford. ( Thank the irresponsible boomer generation for that)  However theres still hope. The government has a pocket knife left! 😆  Because now the Federal Reserve( the only privately owned bank in the USA that is allowed by law to print money for it self) is planning to make NEGATIVE rates.  This means that banks will start handing out. 💸 bonus for those willing to borrowing MORE money. Those Genius. Lol.  But Of Course only the \" Essential\"  will ever get that money, because we all know the propaganda that some of us are more equal the the rest of us.😥.  If this happens then we might as well change our country name to the United Communists of America.  Negative interest rates is the equivalent of throwing a gun at a grizzly bear  after you've shot all your bullets and then attacking it head first with a pocket knife.

Nobody specifies the work you need to do perfectly such that you can avoid having discussions about it.  It’s not possible because PMs don’t know what you know about what’s possible and how difficult potential future work will be.  I’d take the same path if I were you.  Learn to care about others as human beings who are facing their own struggles.  And practice talking to them in a way you both find interesting.  A good starting place is the book “How to Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie.  If you’ve already read it, read it again periodically.

It’s not a personal thing, it’s a risk thing. Felons are liabilities no matter how good they are at a job or how wonderful they are as people. The felon May not pose a risk themselves, but their status as a felon will always be a risk. If something goes wrong and their status comes out, we’re left holding the bag, regardless of whether or not their status had any relevance to the event.   Just as you are being smart and realistic about the unlikeliness of being hired if you pursue higher education, you might also consider that even if you work your way up in a place that will hire you and you like it there, management shuffles over time and one day you might get someone like me in the company who will see your HR file and make it clear to the higher-ups that you have to be contained (because we probably can’t fire you if you already work there). Depending on what the laws are where you’re working, we may not be able to fire you, but we can flag you and basically end your career advancement (I know it’s not fair). Either way, it would be unfortunate for you, and eventually you wouldn’t want to work there anymore. Because risk follows you, your manager would be instructed not to provide a reference.   I wonder though if you would be a good candidate for running your own business, or running one with someone else? A small business environment with very little hierarchy (ie, very few, if any, people like me) would also be a good bet I think. Either be the boss or be close to the boss—that’s probably a real good bet for you. Plenty of people with tarnished pasts do well when they’re not being cock-blocked by risk-averse, white collar folk like myself.   If you can ever pursue a pardon, I highly encourage you to do so.   I wish you the very best. It sounds like you know how to keep at it. Good luck—and sorry for being so blunt."

If you’d like to download a hard copy of my article you can download it from my site.  How to Find and Develop Your Passion in Life  How do people find their passion? That thing that makes them get out of bed every morning excited to face the day? Did they always know what it was or did they learn later in life?  First of all, your passion is not necessarily going to be what you do for a living. You can be great at your job even if it’s not what your passionate about. So let’s divide this exercise into two parts: FINDING YOUR PASSION and FINDING A JOB YOU ARE OK WITH AND THAT ENABLES YOU TO PURSUE YOUR PASSION.   Take a Deep Breath Before we begin we have to be aware that you’re going to feel some discomfort at some point during the exercise. Fear, insecurities, impostor syndrome, what ifs. That’s all normal because change is hard, you’ve probably been in your comfort zone of misery at your job or in your present lifestyle for a while and it’s hard to push yourself out of that comfort zone. For now, just ignore the discomfort. Later we’ll deal with your limits, how far you’re willing to venture out of the zone.  Next, turn off your NEGATIVE SELF-TALK. It’s going to want to say things like, “I could learn how to dance. I’ve always wanted to do that. But there’s no way I can become a dancer at my age!” or “I’ve always wanted to learn how to fly a plane. But it must be so hard. I don’t think I have the time. Plus it must be expensive.” Finding your passion is about taking action not about listening to that negative little voice in your head that keeps you paralized with fear and doubt. It’s not about practicalities right now. It’s about finding out what your passion is and whether your passion is going to be a part of your job or something you do outside of your work.  Steps to Your Passion Get a notebook and let's get started!  What would you be willing to do without getting paid? What can you do for hours without getting bored? How would you spend your time if money weren’t a problem? What do you love to talk about when you’re with friends? Who are you jealous of because of the job they have? Look back at your life and identify moments when you felt great.  What were you doing? What elements combined to make those moments great?  Have you considered that your passion may be something you haven’t tried yet?  If you’ve lived in your comfort zone for a long time, chances are you haven’t tried new things much. What things have you always wanted to try but haven’t yet?  Painting? Learning a language? Writing a book?  What things have you done that you’re proud of?  Close your eyes and imagine yourself 5 years in the future. What are you doing? What lifestyle are you living?  Time to Do Some Cooking Now, start combining hard skills, soft skills and the traits mentioned by the people who know you best.  Let’s imagine these are all ingredients and if we combine some of them, we can bake a cake, if we combine others, we can prepare a salad.  They’re not the same food, but they’re both delicious.  For example, I speak 3 languages + I’m diplomatic + I love to travel = I can be a foreign language teacher abroad. On the other hand, I’m organized + I’m a good writer + I love reading = I can become a freelance editor or copywriter.  As you can see, those are two very different jobs, yet we arrived at both of them combining my different skills.  Steps to Finding the Job You’re OK with As mentioned before, it may turn out that your passion is not your job and that's fine. That's true for most of us. But it's important to find work that doesn't make you miserable. So let's go back to the notebook!  List the jobs you definitely do not want to do or would even consider.  Make a list of your HARD skills. These are measurable abilities, school learned abilities such as writing, reading, math, using computer software.  Make a list of your SOFT skills. Traits such as etiquette, diplomacy, communication, listening, getting along with people.  Talk to your friends and family and ask them to (honestly!) describe your personality. Take notes.  What were you good at in school/college (it doesn’t matter if you liked it or not)? What have you been good at in the jobs you’ve had throughout your life? What matters to you the most when it comes to a career/job: The salary? The hours? The work environment? Doing something you excel at?  Your Passion Be flexible. A study by Stanford psychologists found that most people have the mistaken belief that a passion is something you find easy to do. When people pursued their passion and encountered challenges, they gave up. The researchers further studied mindsets about interests in an experiment where a group of students who identified as “techie” or “artsy” were given two articles to read, one tech related and the other related to the humanities.  Students who had a fixed mindset about their interests were less open to reading an article that was outside their area. Unfortunately, focusing one one area could prevent you from finding your passion, which could happen when you bring different fields together, when you see connections between fields that you might not have thought of before.  A Growth Mindset is More Likely to Lead to Your Passion In another experiment, researchers showed students an interesting video about the origin of the universe. Most students were fascinated. Then they were asked to read a challenging scientific article on the same topic. A lot of students lost their initial excitement and the ones whose enthusiasm for the topic dropped completely were those who had a fixed mindset about their interest. People who may be interested in a subject can change their mind when it becomes too challenging.  “Develop” Instead of “Find” Researchers concluded that “Developing your Passion” is more appropriate than “Finding Your Passion,” because development requires commitment, seeing things through even when they become difficult.  Another path to your passion can be developing valuable skills that will lead to greater career satisfaction because you’ll be financially stable and more likely to develop a passion for a field you’ve cultivated deep expertise in. In other words, first establish the lifestyle you want for yourself and then fit a career around your vision. First get your basic needs taken care of by creating a plan for your life and part of that plan is the development of your Passion.  Passion Still Requires Discipline But no matter which approach you choose to follow, you will never develop your passion if you keep switching directions and following every shiny object that crosses your path.  Even if they have a natural talent, ballet dancers invest years of discipline and hard work on their passion. So do athletes. So do millionaires. And so will YOU.  Now step back and look at the big picture. Is your passion something you can incorporate into your career/job?  Is it something you will be doing on your personal time, after you do your work at a job that is just FINE; it’s not your passion, but it allows you to live well and pursue your passion?"

    - text: "I think this affects people in different ways. It comes down to Maslow's Hierachy of Needs.  People that need to cover their **basic needs** (physiological and safety needs like food, water, warmth, rest, security and safety) will not be in a position to actively choose a career change (whether they liked their job or not). They just need money to have basic living. They might have been in low income jobs with relatively high expenses or even higher income jobs with relatively high outgoings too. If they have lost their job or business, they go back to basic needs.  People that have their basic needs covered, even when they don't have a job (due to low expenses and outgoings and either savings, financially support from elsewhere or passive income from other investments) may then look to fulfill their **esteem needs (around prestige and accomplishment)**. Some may look at self-actualization (to achieve their potential - this is more about growth and contribution to society - looking for greater meaning and purpose in life).  I suspect that t**he time reflecting during lockdown will switch those people focused on prestige and status more to self-actualisation.** People have realised that fancy things are not as important as they thought they were before. It's not as big a deal anymore to have a business meeting on a video call with your kid in the background - this is more acceptable now but never would have been before. Image and luxuries aren't so important to many on reflection. When we are not in control of things in life, we reflect on the most important things. This happens at the time someone dies in particular, but this time of reflection in confinement for many also has made some reflect on some of the well-documented top regrets of the dying (by Bronnie Ware):      **Top Five Regrets of the Dying**  * I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me. * I wish I hadn't worked so much. * I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings. * I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends. * I wish that I had let myself be happier.  So I think **people who are in a position to afford it will be looking for a career change if they were unhappy in their job**. And **those that were happy motivated by money or status before may be thinking to contribute more to society and lead more meaningful lives**. So purpose-driven career change will be more prevalent for this group. However in total numbers, this group of people is by far the minority of people.  The majority of people, particularly in the North America and Europe, will be at least in the short term (next 6 months) be looking to keep their jobs. And if they have lost their jobs, they will be struggling with making basic needs, even with government support.  There will be a huge demand for services that enable people to save money. Any startups that create real solutions in this space will do well.  I am interested myself in those that are looking to make a career change now and why. The ones whose basic needs are not being met will only make career changes because they are forced to as entire industries are changing e.g. travel and hospitality will take some time to recover.   Society and individuals will and have become more resourceful and flexible as a result of this crisis (through necessity), so I think there will be some great startups emerging from this and also people just hustling to make ends meet as there won't be jobs for them for a while.  Who here is looking to make a career change and wants to do something more purposeful now?"

But you’ll never be given that chance if they don’t know you exist.  I always recommend “hacking” the application process by not only submitting their standard form of applying, but trying to make a connect on LinkedIn, trying to meet someone from the company in person (not by stalking, but at a career fair, or maybe if they host an event) or getting creative in that sense. If you can get in front of them with creativity, they usually respect that a lot and remember you."

So you need to figure out what your skills actually are.  But one thing I would say is you really need to figure out your finances, healthcare etc.  You may actually want to move to Europe or something that is not the US.    Also if you have a BS i would not say going back to a 4 year or masters is the best thing because masters are pretty expensive.  I went to a committee college for 2 years and that worked out well although it was too easy given my education (if i could have gotten it done in 1 semester I would have).  If it were me though, knowing what I know now, i'd get back into your field with an actual exit plan, instead of just quitting and hoping something strikes you.  You need funds and indicating that you only have 4-5 months of emergency funds, given no kids or mortgage, means you didn't save nearly enough for a career transition.  It took me about 3 years to go back to my old salary, which was only 40k, and it took 5 years to get above that.   I was able to do it because my wife provided insurance and a livable salary, and we had no kids at the time."

It is likely a symptom of something greater like AVPD, CPTSD, or autism spectrum related. in fact, if you're an introvert in your 50's, and it is interfering with your career, there is an undeniably strong chance of it . I just recently read a post of a 58 y/o newly diagnosed man. I think this would be helpful to you to receive needed help. You are not helping yourself nor your mom by avoiding diagnosis and torturing yourself. 3. Also, this may be hard to hear, but: Your mom, inspite of her best intentions, did not properly prepare you for a successful life. Instead of encouraging you and genuinely pushing and helping you every day to go out and date and get married and have a family of your own, she may have inadvertently stunted your social and emotional growth. Who is going to be there for you when she gets older and passes? What children will look after your wellbeing, if you got none? Been there done that.

I'm sorry you regret your degree, and to be blunt, you are right, it probably won't be that helpful on the job market. That is the risk of being an artist. But it was the choice you made at the time.   Make peace with it. You got to spend time focusing on something you enjoyed, and now you are in a new stage in life with different values. Wishing you had those same values (i.e - financial security) YEARS ago isn't all that fair to your past self. You did what seemed good at the time.   Something you could try to do is informational interviews. This is when you reach out to a professional and meet with them, not to interview for a job, but simply to learn more about their organization, and what they do. Maybe there is even someone at your current software company you could have coffee with a learn a bit more about their job, how they got there, what experiences they've had in the past, what degrees they have, etc.   You can also reach out to other companies. I know of someone who did informational interviews with professionals from over a dozen Human Resources firms, which eventually led to her finding her top two or three HR firms she wanted to work for, so she eventually applied and got a job with one.   More school is always an option, but take your time exploring. You might consider a master's degree, you might consider trade school or a medical technology program. Lots of options out there.

What's to say she won't be dissatisfied with your performance as a husband when you take the pay cut? Sure, you're around more often, but you're worth less money. She's eventually going to want a bigger house for the kids, a few nice vacations, and ongoing placation beyond that.  Are you willing to chase down another person's happiness in lieu of chasing your own dreams?   Sounds like you could really start making huge bucks within the next 4-5 years if you stick with your current trajectory.

That's a terrible reason to pay someone more.  Don't do this.  It sounds like you are  trying to avoid a burden more than get her what is deserved.   First and foremost, do a market survey of typical compensation for someone with her education, skills, experience and salary.  Where does she measure up? if she is truly underpaid, that will be apparent in your research and you can use this.  Market value is where salaries should start and go up from there.  What does her evaluation show as contributions to achieving the goals of the company.  try to quantify how much more than expected was saved or earned because of *her* filling that position.. and that it wouldn't likely have been that way without her.  explain why professionally *you* need her. give examples as to how she helps you focus less on tasks that otherwise would get in the way of taking care of what your boss is really relying on you for.  without her reliably taking them off your radar, your productivity is going to be affected.  Bottom line is people generally stick around mainly because of loyalty, lack of options, money, job satisfaction, opportunities to advance, or geographics.  you should contemplate why would she stay?  if she's already considering leaving.. would money be enough and for how long?"

My advice is to stick it out and just understand this is the work culture in Asia. It's not nice or good, but it is what it is. They will flat out make up negative stuff about you. I've had it happen to me for years. The negative things they make up are often very similar to the problem the administrator has, as you wrote. Just this last year one of my bosses said he was worried I am becoming negative. He made it up completely. Made up a whole story that myself and a coworker got in an argument. That coworker and I laughed so hard together about that. Anyways, the administrator is one of the most negative people you'll ever meet. Hilarious he said I was becoming negative. I take all this with humor. I still get my raises every year (recently quit, actually, but unrelated).  Just try to remember that Asian cultures don't give a lot of praise, but instead criticize and complain a lot, and people above you at work will shit talk you all day. It's not you; it's them. If it was you, they'd fire you. About people ignoring you, also very normal. Reason being is if you can get in on the \"hate train\" the more likely it won't be directed at you. Pretty awful.

People who find careers they're passionate about most often stumble upon them unexpectedly.    Therefore, the best practice would be to try a bunch of careers out via internship, volunteering, and shadowing to see what you enjoy.  Good Luck."

Apply to jobs until you get a better paying one. Don't accept yet, say you have to talk to your employer to make sure you can leave within 2 weeks, \"You don't want to burn any bridges\", all that jazz.  2. Go back to your original employer. Tell them that you would like a 50% (or more, has to be more than the other job you got) pay increase, plus 'time and a half' overtime, because the company lied about several things, including working 18 days straight. You also would like the company to pay for any and all travel related expenses, including personal costs. I'm not sure what type of job it is, but maybe, just maybe, they *actually* need you and are willing to pay more.  3. Here's the fun part. If they agree, you can take the job but as long as it's more than the other new job. Or, you can balk and quit because they were being disrespectful by paying so low in the first place. Or, you can try and renegotiate *again* to get something else, like a $10k bonus to cover the previous time when you were underpaid.  Edit: how did this go from being upvoted to being downvoted??

If they give a 10% raise, most people will probably not want to leave, but payroll just went up 10%. If they give a 0% raise, then payroll doesn't go up, but they are going to have to replace people.  But what if it is in between? Statistically, if they give a 0.5% raise and assume they need to replace 50 people, then they will need to pay 50 new people their full market rate, not to mention recruiting costs and the lost productivity. If they run the numbers again at 2%, then they might have to replace 1 or 2 people at full market rate, but that ends up being a lot cheaper overall than giving *everybody* a higher raise.  That's why it pays to be the employee that leaves for better pay. They know full well that the ones that stay are being paid below what they are worth, and they will continue to pay them below what they are worth as long as they think that enough of them will just take it, complain, but show up on Monday anyway."

Thankfully they are much less frequent now.  1) When I'm at work I'm 110% committed to do what needs to be done, and I god damn do it WITHIN WORKING HOURS. I don't mind coming at 7am and leaving a 8pm if that's whats needed to meet the deadlines. But once I left my desk, unless its a life or death situation, I'm not answering emails, I'm not answering texts. Remember, you're not in the business of saving babies or rescuing old ladies, it can wait till tomorrow!   My off time is mine. Learn to put boundaries or else you will spend 8 months trying to get back on your feet again after you burn out. I survived my burn out and I hope you don't get to experience what I have been through. Never again.   2) My second lesson is learn to delegate. If you can't do it on your own, bitch about it until they give you someone to help you out or give that task to someone else. It might sound desperate or at times unprofessional, but your health comes first. Never forget that.   3) Nobody ever regrets not spending more time at the office while on their death bed.

We did not get along, my productivity went through the floor, and one morning a friend in operations texted me saying \"hey man, sorry about the news.\" I said \"what news?\" and he told me there was a request to disable my computer access because boss was going to fire me. This followed a couple of months of deteriorating conditions on the job, and on this day I had actually gone in early to talk to him about how things were going. [Twilight Zone theme]  I had already received a meeting request that morning from boss for like 10am so I was already thinking in terms of how the next few hours should go. After he went back to hold his 9am daily meeting, I gathered up all my stuff and walked out the front door. A few hours later I got a voicemail from him saying \"You missed a meeting, so I'm going to have to let you go.\" Great reasoning, of course, but I was already done with him, so him giving a weak reason came as no surprise. I was relieved for the first time in a long time. AFAIK he still doesn't know what happened.  In the long run nothing happened as a result, save professional repercussions, and that a few years later I got notice of an Unclaimed Property from them waiting for me at the state. I applied for it and when I got it, it was about the amount of a last check.    Another kinda bad part was that I had bought an expensive car literally the day before all this. I still have it, but it was the most TV thing to have happened through all this. womp womp. Another bad part is that I didn't stay in touch with the guy who tipped me off. We got along really well (rare for me in a huge company) and we should have stayed friends, and all in all I did generally screw myself in terms of references. My bad."

It's fun but I'm scared of messing up especially when someone paid for my services. On a related note opening a cafe has been considered too. *It sounds like you hate your job. I do not see anything positive about what you described.*  This sounds awesome!  Have you considered transitioning into this? I mean by investing more time into this. Simply without any business plan you are guaranteed to set yourself up for failure. I see a lot of poor implementation of great ideas. Did you know that there are places, in the US, that you can rent out kitchens with professional cooking tools? Are there any near where you live?  * Look to other bakeries to see what they're doing - maybe you'll learn something    * See if they are hiring -- this is hands on experience that could expand your skills beyond the hobby    * You will learn if you like making cakes as a job, or not       * It is something entirely different when one is required to do something with a deadline while feeling extremely lazy, or sick, or stressed * Look to online blogs about making cakes - you might find some tips that could help you    * this is the best part of your craft: you will learn interesting shapes and designs that you'd never consider possible * Make cakes ad nauseam - you will get more practice and more confidence. You will find what works best.    * Give yourself reasons to bake a cake. Invite friends over for cake and coffee. Offer to make cakes for birthdays. And don't worry about making 10 cakes, if you can afford it. Maybe have 1 cake that you can practice that design you're seeking, and the other cake as the final product for whomever.       * I knew someone who loved making cakes and she made cakes for everyone for every occasion. * Identify Market    * I am from Boston, MA in the US and the one thing that we have plenty is Irish bars, Irish 'pubs', and Irish cooking. I see often a new establishment where Irish something is on offer to add to the collection of Irish-American establishment trying to offer something unique; how unique can another Irish/American place be until it can't be passed as Irish?     * As a baker seeking a market, you get peckish and seek donuts or doughnuts or olykoek, if I have the name right. You drive around for 30 minutes and you find a few generic chains that offer what you seek, but you want something different. Finally, after driving an hour away from home you find a shop that offers something with more of a personalized quality - different flavor, different sizes, and different ingredients. BAM! You have yourself an opportunity to add something to the community closer to you. Now the real groundwork is to find out if people are open to a new bakery offering donuts. What works 30 minutes away might not be great in vegantown, UK. That might be the reason why it took 30 minutes to find a location. * Learn how to effectively run a business    * Do you want to cater to cake orders online or do you want to have a physical location?    * What type of cakes do you want to make? Are you offering limited selection of flavors? Are you offering fancy designs found in a wedding cake?    * What is your competition charging? I saw elsewhere on reddit that wedding cakes are charged 3x more than just the average cake; someone ordered a cheesecake for 2 people and paid about 2-3x the price because it was a wedding cake even though there wasn't much to the design.        * Consider this - you think you can stand out and be the baker that can charge half than the rest of your fellow bakers. You try it but find on one particular day that you're having bad luck. The cakes aren't coming out perfect, or you're distracted and the design is shit. So, you try again, and again. Before you know it, the combined effort adds up to more money in time and resources than you would had received just producing other cakes. The extra cost might be because of the planning and consideration going into producing the cake for a wedding. How many people do you know are unsure of the price of their planned wedding cake before pickup?  These are just things to consider. I thought to just answer noticing where your true passion lies. Good luck."

OP has NO convictions. But nursing programs are very competitive. Paralegal programs can be completed by literally anyone. There is no admission process, unlike nursing, which would include a rigorous course of study before even being allowed into the program, followed by an admittance process. Only 3 states bar someone with a felony from practising law. OP just wants to be a paralegal, not even a lawyer.  Criminal lawyers would arguably be a lot more comfortable employing someone with a criminal history because their clients are criminals or accused criminals and they know that a lot of times shit happens.  OP, my only concern would be that paralegal jobs are going away pretty quickly. Especially since the recession.

If they won't, then quit one of the jobs and keep the job that pays the most.  Then, with all this extra time you have, hunt for a better paying job. Tell potential employers you're willing to work 60 hours a week if the pay is enough to compensate for that extra time.  I would not pay down the debt immediately. Build up a 10k nest egg first.

    - text: "You should just talk to them about it, period, especially if your current project is wrapping up. I have worked with consultants in IT for a long time (and my spouse works for the big 4)—travel burnout is not at all uncommon. It’s all about how you frame the discussion.    Rolling off your current project is a really good time to address this with your department head, or resource/staffing person.   Some projects require more travel, some require less.  As you’re wrapping up the current project, just tell them all the good things you have said here, and be positive—as in, “I love what I’m doing, but for my next role, if there is any consideration for less onsite work or a project that is closer to [home], I would like to be considered for it, given the increased onsite presence requirement that my last project demanded.”   We have people asking for lower-travel projects all the time, for tons of different reasons—their health, issues at home, general burnout, etc.  This kind of stress on your body does take a toll, and you have to take care of yourself.  Last year I had a young (<30 years old) consultant  pass away from a heart attack.... before he did, he was texting his boss from the ER because it was go-live.  Not trying to be a downer, just saying to keep perspective.     It absolutely never hurts to ask, and it’s much easier to be in a position to try and accommodate  this request when you’re going to be placed on your next project, versus you throwing your hands in the air at cutover refusing to travel anymore—which I have also seen, and does not go over well.  You should proceed delicately since I read above that it’s your first project, but if you frame it in a positive way, no one can really fault you for simply asking.   Don’t demand, don’t complain, don’t make comparisons to coworkers or friends’ companies, just ASK for consideration, and frame more as a “less travel now, will do more for next project” kind of way.  In larger firms, it’s also more likely that they could do something about it, since they presumably have a lot more options as to where you could be placed.   If they are a good employer and value you as it seems they do, they will do their best to accommodate you.  We make every effort to put someone on a lower-travel project after they have been killin it on a FT travel role for the better part of the year.  You have to do what you can to take care of your employees in these kinds of roles, because if you don’t, they will leave.    Which brings me to my point—if they absolutely can’t decrease your travel or aren’t willing to consider it...or if their pipeline is only mega-travel intensive projects, then start looking for another job. The job market in your industry is insanity right now, if we sleep on getting someone through the interview process by even one day, we are losing people.    You only get one life, don’t sacrifice your body, health, or sanity for anyone."

You should love your work hopefully, enjoy the environment, but the minute you “drink the kool-aid,” and allow yourself to begin working long hours (esp unpaid overtime), you’re done. Love your work, but realize that it’s just a job and for all their startup y’all, they are a company that does not actually care about you.  Now the flip side of that is you have to learn the culture and mission in order to manipulate the bosses so you can move up the latter and get your work/ needs prioritized.  Just my two cents. I’ve been at a start up for 3 years. I’ve done the massive overtime thing, but failed at manipulating management and cultural jargon like some others. I’m done, burnt out to hell.  Edit: wanted to add this: the startup environment can be great. Like another person mentioned, it can be like working with a close group of friends. But that changes as the organization grows. Once you’re over 30-35 people they start to become more corporate while still paying lip service to the startup mentality.

Look at it this way:  In your words, you were in a \"don't give a shit\" attitude, so you *wanted* to leave. Your tardiness was just a surface manifestation of something deeper—*not being valued by the company.* So instead of up and quitting, you essentially got them to fire you by showing up late. I'm sure you're not the type of person who is incapable of showing up on time. After all, you were in a senior level position.  So, the true reason you and the company parted ways was a difference in what you valued. Sure, on paper they fired you, but the true reason was that you and the company had different values.  Now when it comes to discussing this with potential employers, it's important to present it in an amicable way. Something like you \"outgrew the position\" or are just looking to be challenged further. Personally, if someone had \"drama\" at their last position I'm very suspect as they're bound to repeat history. If you need to use a reference from your last job, it's important you communicate why you left as well, so they understand.  That being said, it's important that you analyze what happened in your last position so it doesn't happen again. I would ask yourself \"How was I complicit in creating the conditions at my last job that I said I didn't want?\" I'm sure the company had some fault as they weren't paying you enough, but it's important to see what part *you* played in not getting payed enough, or not being valued."

And something triggered this change in group behavior. You need to figure out what it was.  Nobody would like being forced into social isolation. However if it gets to the point where it's making you cry everyday and you dread work, that's a red flag against yourself. Did a similar situation ever happen to you during your childhood, like in school or something? And was your reaction the same as now ? You might be a person that is high in agreeableness, maybe you're a very sensitive person.  And that's not a nice thing to be in the average workplace. Like at all.   The workplace can be very socially intense, there's always an underlying atmosphere of friction and competitiveness. You really don't want to give off the impression that you're too nice and agreeable, too harmless, too emotional, not having the courage to confront people. Or else people will just step over you. I suspect that's what's going on here.  Maybe that girl you mentioned is a polar opposite of you personality-wise. And as a consequence she maybe hates you and has no respect for you and somehow communicated that sentiment to the group and the other co-workers resonated with it. Why would they lie to you over tea or lunch ? Maybe they think you're too soft, maybe they're talking behind your back about how lame you are and how you're probably crying in the bathroom every day. This is just my suspicion, but you tell whether that can be true or not.  Bottom line is that you need to stand up for yourself, and not accept that people lie to your face about not going to tea while you know they are doing so behind your back (make sure you're 100% sure though!). Not accept that they just ignore you by saying they're too busy, which is a total BS excuse btw, don't accept that. If you do, it's over, you're invisible, you don't matter, you're annoying, why bother inviting you? You gotta have some presence, don't be non-confrontational, show that you're not a pushover.  Whatever you do, don't just run runaway to another working environment. Your coworkers will get the last laugh and if you get to a new workplace then it might be the same thing all over again. Or worse.  Whatever you do, wipe away your tears. You allowed yourself to let other people's behavior towards you hurt you. Address the vulnerability and reclaim your emotional stability. Being socially ostracized hurts but maybe you are a part of the problem. Of course the behavior of your coworkers is straight up \"middle-school clique\" childish but hey some people are just immature / just as insecure as you and they will follow the group like sheeps.  Hope some of this helps, I used to be very shy, sensitive, agreeable, but now I'm not a pushover anymore and I don't accept shit from anyone. I encourage you to hold yourself to a fair standard"

One friend is a super introvert, and uses up her people-energy in her very people-oriented job. She loves it, but it means she doesn’t come to drinks with us very often. Another friend was initially hesitant to take a more people-oriented job, but found that people take his input more seriously BECAUSE he doesn’t talk constantly.   I’m not sure what your role as an assistant editor entails, but there are some communications roles that really don’t require a lot of people-interaction. Larger companies, weirdly, are going to be better, because each job can be more specific, instead of a five-person team where everyone is overlapping job duties a bit.   As for whether management roles are harder to get if you’re quiet, it depends on the company. It can take longer to be noticed and offered up for a management role. However, sometimes the quiet ones have paid more attention and do better than the loud ones. For example, one of my best supervisors was a woman who was originally hired into the same role I had. I had been with the company a couple years, and actually helped train her. She was quiet and watchful and asked excellent questions. When our supervisor left, I was unsurprised they offered her the job, but she was TERRIFIED that I would resent her promotion. I told her honestly that I was terrified that they would try to promote me, because working with her had shown me that I didn’t sit back quietly and WATCH and digest nearly as much as I should have been! So, take that anecdote as you will.   And good luck!"

Maybe my advice is to pick a skill-based job like making posters or copywriting and stick with it while slowly learning whatever new skill you want.

The important thing to know is people talk about their rates, no matter what you tell them. So keeping your people whole is important, especially on a staff 20 to 50 people. If people aren't performing I will not give them a beg merit increase or raise and tell them why. I will give them something just not a lot. Because if your not pulling your weight and not turning it around the are other people that will want their job.  Promotions I normally make when there is room and the person can fit the position, not wholly, on a basic level. I make the decision based on their prior work and performance. If you want a promotion show me you want it. Attitude and how they talk to others is the most important. I dont need lower managers talking down to employees."

What the question is trying to ask is, say you have two jobs, A and B. And let's say they both pay the same, let's say $60K just for argument's sake. If you have two offers, you'll take the job that seems to have the best work, obviously.  But let's say B pays $65K. Do you automatically take B? Or do you take A if the work is clearly better? What if it's $70K? $80K? $100K?  The 'correct' answer - and by 'correct' I mean actually correct and not just 'interview correct' - is that you prefer the better job \\_unless\\_ the pay for that job is clearly not market, i.e., you're being taken advantage of. Now, it's incredibly unlikely that a job will both have good work and be making a substantially below market offer. So it's a pretty artificial question.   But let's look at a somewhat real comparison. You have two offers. One is an $80K entry level developer job at what seems to be a good company. The other is a $110K job as a union garbage collector.

It’s only going to better for your career if you a) develop new skills that will directly help you succeed in your future career, or b) you are finding it hard to continue progressing due to burn out, and you need that mental refresher.

Only you'll be able to say if teaching English online could for you, but it's a possibility.

Depending on your timezone, you'll be working around 7pm Beijing time, which is 6am Eastern Standard Time, and you need to sit through 30 minute lessons, have only 5 mins break in between lessons if you book them back to back (though you don't need to). In general, I think the flexibility of the job might make it accessible to you. One good thing about the job is when I had a recent flare-up I was able to take about 2 weeks off completely to recover, with no penalties, and then could gradually start teaching again at my own pace.     Anyways, [here's a post I made about the job.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/dsi205/my_review_after_several_months_teaching_english/) Please PM me if you have any questions, and good luck with finding work.

Litigation is deadline-heavy, places a tremendous amount of pressure because a wrong move can cost your client their case. Every day you face a new legal issue, much of the time you don’t have great guidance. The field does teach you to teach yourself, which is certainly a nice skill to have. But it’s extremely stressful, not much work satisfaction, and lawyers are 3x more likely to suffer from depression (me being one of them). The pay is not enough for most lawyers to pay down their loans at the rate that those loans are growing with interest. Hours are long, you are almost always expected to work longer than everyone else and in litigation, you have unexpected late nights regularly. As a mom, this is extremely difficult because I have daycare pick up, so causes an issue with my husband’s work schedule. The worst part of litigation IMO is that your opponents are out to crush you in order to win, and that creates a very combative and hostile work environment. It takes a certain personality to be a bulldozer. As for non-lit jobs, I never chose to do them because what I have been exposed to I’ve found dreadfully boring. I absolutely love the law, from a theoretical standpoint, and yet I regret and resent the fact that I became a lawyer. It makes me sad that I feel this way, having planned to be a lawyer since I was in middle school, but it’s the truth. Law school is an extremely expensive financial decision that could have a serious impact on your financial future, so be aware of that when you go into it."

Anyone who works in the real world knows you get promoted if you do good work, go above and beyond, and last but most important... if an opportunity opens up.

One time when I was unemployed, I considered looking in other areas for jobs and applied for a few out of state.  I got calls back from the recruiters about them, but they'd say they were hesitant to hire someone from out of state or wouldn't pay for relocation (which was fine with me).  At the same time, sometimes I get contacted from recruiters about jobs all across the country..  It seems like some places are afraid to hire from out of state, and some aren't.  Also at that time, I was contacted by a hiring manager at a company within my state but in a different city, about 3-4 hours drive from where I was living.  At first I wasn't sure I'd want to move there, so I didn't respond, but he contacted me again a week later and I decided it wouldn't hurt to try.  I suppose the hiring manager liked what he saw on my resume to contact me again.  I made it through the phone interviews and in-person interview, and they hired me.  So I guess if a place likes you enough and you seem to fit in, you have a chance."

Now, I am in some sort of limbo where I was not even sure what I wanted to do. So I started trying many things which further dispersed my goals and makes me seem like someone who does not know what he wants. Moved to another country and took the first job I landed. Totally unrelated with my career. Also, I have a very cold personality so I am not very charismatic. I spent a lot of time trying to fix my social behaviours. Trying to be a lot more conversational than I feel comfortable and many other things. Bottom line is I keep getting rejected from HR jobs which is my major and I hold about 3 years of experience in the hr team of large multinationals. Last one ended about three 4 ago.  Finally, I am unemployed again and I decided something different. I cannot enroll in a masters degree rn, money is an issue. I seeked professional help and assessed my personality and I finally decided to accept those traits that people do not often like to admit. For example, I am not a multitasker, I am more logical than emotional, I am an excellent team player, however I kinda hate interacting too much with people. I'm shit at small talk.  What I am doing now is the following. I am studying data analytics on my own by taking online courses that I can afford. I focussed my CV on those skills that I actually feel comfortable admitting to. We are sold the idea sometimes that everyone has to be charismatic and all that stuff, but I am ready to stop trying to be someone I am not and play with my strengths. I am switching the focus of my career from HR to other departments like admin, accountings, finance, which are areas I am really good at grasping and fast. Now, most jobs I apply for I feel confident. I still apply to some hr jobs that favor my traits. I am very procedural and structure oriented instead of a more open and creative person.  I started changing my profile this week, so I will post you guys on any updates.

There's an added bonus potential of meeting someone who could connect you with your next job opportunity. * *Celebrate all of your successes.* If you landed an interview but didn't ultimately get the job, that still means your materials were awesome enough to get you an interview. Likewise, if you set a goal to send out 10 applications per week, and you reach your goal, celebrate! Remembering to take pride in the small victories can help keep you moving.  * *Post positive reminders.* Use phone notes, sticky notes, a whiteboard \\- whatever method will grab your attention \\- and inundate yourself with positive messages. Try posting inspirational quotes, short\\-term goals, or pictures of loved ones to keep you motivated.  Best of luck!"

Most managers at large companies are not idiots, they understand some employees are underpaid or can be paid more, it does not really mean I will hold it against you if you stayed, in fact you may get more concessions for loyalty (moving to a group you want, taking on more responsibilities, growth, remote etc). I understand concerns about reprisal, but depending on the industry/state you work in this is actually very dangerous for the company as it leads to expensive and hard to win lawsuits.   It's unfortunately never black and white and has alot to do with your dynamics with your manager, what kind of a person he is and what kind of culture the company has."

As a frame of reference, I applied to statistics and biostatistics programs in the US this past fall (you can see my results in my post history) and I'll be joining a PhD program this fall.   First, a few things about stats grad school in the US. Most PhD programs in the US allow you to Master out if you finish the first two years (all of the programs I visited had this option). Statistics and biostatistics PhD programs aren't that different (at least in the US). The main difference is that stats programs tend to be a bit more theoretical. You don't need a stats MS to be competitive for a stats PhD. A good number of successful applicants haven't taken any stats classes (I only took two).   Second, an answer to your question. The biggest parts of a stats or biostats PhD application are letters of rec and math grades. Research experience isn't prioritized as much since undergrads usually don't do real stats research. That's not to say don't do research; it's a great  way to get great letters and learn about the field. With respect to math grades, competitive applicants usually have mostly A's in math classes. Multivariable calc, linear algebra, and real analysis are pre-reqs for most stats PhDs. Good grades in pure math classes make you more competitive. If you'd like to see some applicant profiles, look at the Mathematics and Statistics section of GradCafe. Just keep in mind that you shouldn't compare yourself too much.  This information comes from stats professors I've talked to, GradCafe, and my personal experience. I hope it helps!"

First thing to understand is imposter syndrome seems practically to be a requirement for being a grad student. Seriously, everybody has it. If your lab group is not full of rude, terrible people they will not look down on you for not being as good as they are. You are certainly not going to be as good as they are at the beginning because you're just starting, that just makes sense. I struggled with this as well, and here's what helped me. Say you are the worst graduate student in the group. Who cares? Use this time and this experience to improve yourself and work on something you're interested in. You got admitted, which means that the people who's job it is to decide if someone will be a good fit, decided you would be a good fit. You demonstrated that you have the required background and ability, but grad school is more of an exercise in grit than intelligence. What's the worst case scenario?

You can be rejected from a program, and then accepted by a far stronger program a year later. There are too many factors to be able to predict this with any sense of certainty.

If you have facebook open, your phone on the table with whatsapp etc. then it's never going to work.  Procrastinators usually perform in \"sprints\" where they crunch before a deadline. That is not an effective strategy long-term. You need to learn to do it every (work) day.  Behaviorism is pretty useful here. Just like you were trained to poop in the toilet instead of in your pants and perhaps trained to brush your teeth, wash your hands etc. you can train yourself to do work. Consistency and establishing a routine is key. It's a lot easier to just stick to a daily routine than try to come up with some new behavior.  I went to the army and we woke up at 06:00 every morning, had 10 minutes to put some clothes on, use the toilet and be ready to move out for food. First week was chaotic and sucked, 11 months later we'd have time to chat and mess around and browse reddit on our phones. Things like making your bed, going to eat at specific times, cleaning your barracks every day, cleaning your gun etc. just became habits that you did and didn't feel terrible anymore. To the new recruits we seemed like gods of war because we could put up a tent in 15 minutes, get a fire going and fall asleep on a pile of logs and branches (better than cold uneven ground). It's just habit and having done it 100 times before.  Years later and I can't wake up at 06:00 to save my life, even a little bit of pressure from a hurry turns the whole morning into a chaotic mess and I haven't made my bed for a long time and I clean my apartment maybe once in a few months.

Your school center should have some good suggestions of what accommodations are common and/or most helpful.   Remember, just because you are granted accommodations doesn’t mean you have to use them every time. From my understanding, it’s better to have accommodations in place now that you don’t have to invoke than to need them and have to go through the whole process again.   I haven’t had accommodations myself, but I had many undergraduates in my class who did and the whole process seemed to go well. Common accommodations were extended time on exams, excused absences, and flexible assignment dates. The key is to always be in contact with your professor. If you need extra time, let them know as far ahead as you can. If you don’t communicate, then frustration on both sides can easily build."

Many math departments also have faculty doing research in probability theory. However, probability isn't so broad or popular a field that it would be sensible to, for example, offer a full master's degree in just probability.  In terms for how to proceed, *not all programs are created equal* and you are just going to work harder to figure out what will work for you. Since you are already taking relevant classes, your professor(s) in the field can offer advice. Some departments are starting to offer separate statistics and data science degrees, partly so that the \"statistics\" degree can remain more theory-oriented -- so, in a way, it could be helpful to look at which schools do offer a data science degree.    Ultimately, if you're much more interested in and committed to theory, it may make more sense to apply directly to PhD programs instead. Master's degrees are meant to be more practical."

Take multiple authors and put them in dialogue with each other - what does author A say, and how does author B's point contradict that or strengthen the argument? Comparing and contrasting the work of different authors is a helpful way to figure out the shortcomings in the overall body of work as well, and can help identify a problem with the literature that you can try to solve with your work.  I also agree with the previous posts and don't think they necessarily contradict each other - go into the research and find what about it excites you, then explore the work done in that niche and work out the problems with the existing work.  The problem isn't not having foundational knowledge (I switched from a social science during undergrad to the humanities in postgrad - I had absolutely NO foundational knowledge but could still formulate research questions in the new field) but more about confidence. It takes some gut to say that another author, especially an established one, is doing something in a manner that could be done better, or that experts in the field are missing certain connections, or whatever -- but every single author is just a human being with limitations, and sometimes we get so stuck in our pattern of thinking that we forget some very obvious connections elsewhere. If you keep thinking about it as a shortage of knowledge, you just end up in a loop where you never feel like you know enough. There's always more to learn!

Do you know how many students in this class are probably friends that put each others names to get points? Going from an A, not to an A-, but to a B+ IS a huge grade jump for a system that rewards friends for putting each others names. As a current instructor I think this is entirely unfair and would NEVER do this. Students very rarely are able to accurately assess contributions to learning or engagement, and most of the time, esp. for online classes, THEY DON'T CARE. It is far more likely they are putting friends names or random names than carefully considering who has been effectively participating (especially when many of them themselves probably haven't been). For this to affect OPs tuition assistance is horrible. I honestly cannot fathom how people are defending this."

I was in plant science specializing in crop biotech, but I just can't muster up the effort to care about that anymore.  In 25 years of time, the entirety of the US university system has produced two results in plant biotech.  That's it, two results in a quarter century, and one won't even be on the market for a few years.  I tried to work with so many people to do something about that, I could have done more, but there was a grand total of zero interested in doing their damned job.  They're either incompetent, or paid off corporate shills, and po-tay-to po-tah-to at this point.  And God forbid you talk about anything that isn't a corn/soy monoculture.  Eventually, I dropped out of my PhD program because, first off, that particular place was a mess (they sent me to a ill equipped research station in the middle of nowhere that never should've been built, which was a little detail they neglected to mention when I accepted), and second, the whole field is a disaster.  Science is about making the world a better place for humanity, and in case you haven't noticed there's an impending climate crisis that's going to demand an increased focus on sustainability, but all they're interested in is sitting on their hands and taking about how much they love their corporate handlers.  What a waste of two degrees and too many years, I should have gone into medical biotech from the start, at least that has a future.  No wonder there's an anti-GMO movement, they might be science denialists but they're fully justified in their suspicions, and I am very close to going to Twitter and letting them know exactly how I feel, and since those quacks are always looking for vindication from people with degrees that would be very bridge burn-y but it isn't like I have anything else going for me.

Learning to love actively keeps both people in a relationship able to constantly support one another, which improves quality of life both for each individual as well as the couple as a whole. Active love could be creative but is often made up of mundane things that matter little to oneself but a lot to one's partner.  Perseverance despite difficulty allows the relationship to be longterm. Without it, there is no hope of a future. And, the longer it is practiced, the more equinamity and perspective a person develops because they begin to see the large bumps in the metaphorical road as small bumps over a long course. The more difficulties a couple passes through together, the more confident they become that they will be able to surmount other challenges in the future.  Creative problem-solving is useful but I don't see it as the most important quality to come out of a relationship. Rather I would say it is more a sense of agape, of old, familiar, altruistic, and well-humored love."

Find an EE lab with an emphasis on applications rather than theory. Try and get into a top 10 school. Stanford, Berkeley, Michigan, Penn all have outstanding relevant programs. If you're not that competitive, aim for a school that's made a mark on the field. University of Utah, for example, developed the Utah Electrode Array, the only penetrating microelectrode array approved for human clinical trials, is the origin of the original neural amplifier, and is home to 2  prominent neural companies (Blackrock and Ripple). UT Dallas is also in a good situation for a lower ranked University with Abbott neuromodulation being local.  If you get the above, your dreams of academia are possible. The competition for TT faculty is lower for EE than probably any other field. This is because EE PhDs make so much money in industry, why would you accept *half* as much to teach? It's insane (I am TT EE faculty, btw). In fact, many EE faculty don't even do postdocs, which are required for virtually every other academic field.  The next step is to tailor your PhD to the job you want. Teaching oriented colleges want to see industry experience, so get internships in the summer. They also require that you have teaching experience and would prefer if you had experience training undergrads in research and projects, so try and become a senior project advisor during your PhD or mentor undergrads in your research lab. See if your institution has any \"teaching higher Ed\" courses or similar. Mine had an emphasis for phds seeking TT jobs.  Make sure you talk to faculty at other institutions. Connections will be king. I applied to over 20 positions, got interviews from all 3 where I or my advisor new someone, and only 2 of 20 where I didn't. Applying to faculty positions is hard. It took me more than 8 hours per application. Wasting time on applying to places you don't know people, and thus have a low chance, is painful (but necessary).   If  you don't land an academic job, there are government jobs. Federal jobs are incredibly annoying to apply to, but there are some really cool positions. It is best if you can find a mentor to help you figure out how to apply to the fed jobs, because they are weirdly particular.   There are also the national labs. National labs fall somewhere between industry and academia. Berkeley national lab is particularly interesting and it specifically has no classified research and had a neuroscience division. Engineers there will usually work as solution innovators for various other departments. I spent 2 years at one and worked with neuroscientists, physicists, biochemists, and others."

When I visited my native country and talked with my colleagues there, if everyone present could speak our native language, of course we spoke our native language. When I didn't know some term in it, I just said it in English, and usually someone told me the translation. If I wasn't sure what someone is talking about, I'd ask. Altogether it happened only a few times, not enough to notably slow down communication, my colleagues seemed used to it (many people they know do their PhDs abroad, and most visit more often than I), and I don't think it was a problem. And of course it's useful for me to this way learn the current terminology in my native language.  Of course, if you aren't actually fluent in that language and have difficulties following to the extent that having the conversation in English would be more efficient than such occasional explanations, and you understanding and/or contributing to the meeting is important, you should ask for the meeting to be held in English."

Let me give you another opinion though from a Bourdieusian cultural sociologist:   Nothing says \"I don't belong\" or \"I'm really educated!\" like preemptively proving that you belong or are highly educated.   In other words, whether you should do this or not really depends on your field (in both senses) but the higher status the field you are in, the less you want to hang up your diploma. Briefly, putting up your diploma shows that you think of the diploma as a significant accomplishment. But for an ACTUALLY high status person (not just a nouveau riche, or equivalent) getting such a credential is no big deal at all.   So, by hanging up your diploma, you are basically sabotaging your own symbolic capital - the capital/advantages that come along with 'looking the part' and acting as if succeeding in a given field was perfectly natural and unconsciously achieved. Hanging it up might impress people - but it will only likely impress people with LESS cultural and symbolic capital than you (and therefore the people who can benefit you the least) because everyone with more capital than you will likely have the same or better credential anyway.   Your diploma does not distinguish you from people with more educational/cultural capital than you. Rather, it distinguishes you from people with less. However, the important point here is the GROUP THAT YOU ARE PUTTING YOURSELF IN.   (All of this is not completely unrelated to why people like Steve Jobs wore jeans and T shirt to investors meetings where gazillions would be discussed etc... 'all in a day's work for someone as comfortable with this status/world as I am.' It's the overdressed people who out themselves as uncomfortable, like they don't REALLY belong there.)  Of course, I am not saying all of this is NECESSARILY true (as different fields have different logics). But this is one answer that I didn't see in the comments and wanted to share - after all, you have an advanced degree now!   In summary: I'd look to see what your role models and mentors do and follow them."

If you can address such concerns, then yes, you should be honest with your PI whenever the discussion gets related to your career development / post-PhD future. Most reasonable PIs are actually relieved when they don't have to worry about how to train and place their students for academic career, as long as the students' alternative career plans are sensible and non-embarrassing (e.g., planning to be a janitor, a meth cook or a scammer wouldn't be well-received, but a relevant research/development industry career would, even if the PI may not be able to help much unless they just happen to have contacts in it)."

Con: At the end of the day being on a committee does not mean the application will be read differently. Those institutions that rely on service work will stick you with that service work anyway.

Will you call upon students at random or only those who raise their hands?  One strategy I used as a TA was “wait a minute” questions. These would be open questions throughout the lecture that students would have one uninterrupted minute to think about a response to. Even if they had difficulty thinking of anything, we could process that struggle as a group.   As an instructor with only 8 students, make sure you know each of their names and use them regularly. Make it a habit to integrate what they share in class into your teachings (e.g., “does this remind anyone else of Twyla’s example from last week?”). Check in with students throughout the course about, asking them what they appreciate and what maybe isn’t resonating with them. Listen to what they say without being defensive and be gracious for their feedback. Students can be amazingly forgiving and supportive of instructors who they perceive actually cares about them.

I've also been in the navy so have experience with a high stress long hour job and did fine there, which has immensely helped me realize it's this specific work that is not right for me.  I also switched majors from envi sci to cell bio in undergrad, so am planning to return to envi sci for a more applied job. My biggest regret is that I was in a 5 year undergrad+masters envi sci program and will now at some point need to start over and spend 2 years getting that masters degree, but try to be positive about things. The more important thing for me is that I know myself and I would have constantly been questioning whether I should have done a biomed PhD if I didn't try this. I've also learned and am sure you have whether you realize it or not a ton about juggling tons of tasks, prioritizing, time management, preparing presentations for a specific audience, etc.   Good luck with everything and I hope it works out! If you do end up leaving for whatever reason remember this- you can dwell in negatives and view yourself as a failure that wasn't good enough.

Wednesday’s are my “off days” I give to myself. I might do some reading in the morning, but I really use it to run errands, and I might I allow myself a few hours to play video games with my friends. Thursday’s is another class days, so that’s also spend reading and in class. I’m almost constantly busy, which is exhausting and I really don’t have the ability to fit in any last minute plans, but it’s working for now I guess. I’m hoping I can land a graduate student job and quit my full time job so I can go full time in school and really just give my all to that, but it’s not looking like that’s going to happen at this point, so I’ll keep this little system I have in place."

At various times I've put a tube in the overhead bin, let a flight attendant tuck it in a handy nook behind a row of seats, and checked the tube (I own a heavier-duty plastic poster tube I picked up from an art supply store) so I didn't have to deal with it.  I could also see you being asked to gate-check the tube if it's a crowded flight. If you're flying one of the low-cost carriers, they might also look for a way to ding you for some kind of extra-bag charge.  In all cases, make sure you've got your name and contact info on the outside of the tube, just in case you get separated. (Have a digital copy of your poster with you, too--in the worst-worst-case scenario, you might be able to get the poster reprinted at a local print show.)   One time I paid a bit of a premium for printing on fabric so I could fold the poster and put it in my laptop bag.  The last time I went to a conference, I went business class by train (the boss signed off on it because it was cheaper than flying economy class).  Lounges at both ends, complimentary food and drinks on board, lots of legroom, and no worries about luggage or poster storage space.  And the train station was across the street from the conference hotel, which was handy after all the free booze."

At the start of the week, I’ll figure out what the biggest task for each day will be and try to coordinate that around any meetings or classes I have (i.e. Monday will be experiment A, Tuesday will be literature review, Wednesday will be animal colony management, etc.). I’m generally less effective on Mondays and Fridays so I try to leave those days for easier, less brain-intensive stuff. Every morning I sit down and make a list of every single task I need/want to get done that day (I am super scatterbrained and will forget to do stuff if I don’t do this), and anything that doesn’t get finished that day gets kicked to the next day’s to do list.   My boss doesn’t care when I come into lab as long as I’m getting stuff done, but I prefer to get in by 9. I really prefer to finish all my work (including studying) before I go home if possible because I’m much less efficient there, so I’ll stay however long I need to which varies by day based on my workload, so yesterday I worked 11 AM-7 PM, today I worked 7AM-5PM, tomorrow I’ll probably work 10 AM-3 PM, etc. I try very hard not to go into lab on weekends, because I’ve worked research jobs before where the boss expected me to be there every damn day, including the weekends, and it burned me out so badly that I was overall less effective and efficient at getting stuff done, even during the regular work week. Obviously I’ll do stuff at home when I need to (for example, I’m preparing for quals right now so I’ve been doing a few hours of studying once I get home most nights too), but I prefer to be done and be able to relax and have dinner, watch tv, or work on one of my hobbies when I get home.   I schedule reading/studying/project work in a planner every week, similar to how I plan my week in lab. Life responsibility stuff and social stuff also go in this planner (as well as my Google calendar for events/appointments so my phone will remind me, since, as I mentioned above, I’m scatterbrained as fuck). I DEFINITELY suggest scheduling fun/social stuff/breaks or even putting one night a week aside where you don’t do any work or school stuff.

Have 3 stories prepared for an interview where you wind up the rockstar: you advocated for a changed procedure in your lab, you won a poster contest at a conference, you helped a student pass their course in your lecture, etc.   Within each of those stories, you should have an answer to just about any behavioral interview question that could arise.

I went on to do a MSc right after my bachelor, and I wouldn't say I regret it, but it wasn't the wisest choice of mine: I went for a comparative politics master at the London School of Economics. After graduating, I started interning for the UN, the EU and other organizations, and realized my main area of interest is security, peace and conflict, political instability. If I would have done internships before my MSc, then my choice for grad course would have definitely been international relations or conflict studies, other 2 masters offered by the London School of Economics but different from mine. Some say my choice was great because I graduated with a master at 23 years old and started UN career at the same age, but now you know what? I'm searching for another master, whether in the US or in the UK, to get some international relations/human rights/security studies credentials.   If you are unsure about what your career will be, or you have a broad interest in a huge topic (that was my case: international relations and politics), do some work to get a more specific choice orientation towards your postgraduate education."

There are some people in my cohort who did not write a thesis during their MAs. They made a portfolio or something of work they've done in their courses, or wrote an extra seminar paper. Here are some of the questions, struggles, frustrations, etc. they've shared with me:  -they don't know what the IRB is or what the rules are (whereas I had to figure it out and learn it from my advisors as my thesis was person-based)  -they've never written anything longer than 20 double-spaced pages and they have no idea how to pace themselves or how long it'll take them, or how to write transitions and be consistent across multiple chapters  -they don't quite understand or appreciate the method and methodology sections of papers as much because they've never had to go through the process themselves  -their work mainly revolves around theory and already-published works, which makes it harder for them to publish (at least in our field)   This probably greatly varies by field, but in mine where we do quite a bit of qualitative research, not writing & researching a thesis puts you at a bit of a disadvantage NOT necessarily for admissions but for your progress in the program. My cohort who had capstone experiences are not as prepared as those of us who wrote 3-5 chapter theses. If you can write a thesis, definitely do it, because it seriously teaches you so much and prepares you for the kind of work you'll be doing in the PhD (the diss, of course, but other more involved studies you may take up along the way).

Chemistry and I will let you know what I have observed in the real world 2018 and later years. This is just my own personal observation and my point of view. If you would like to be employable the best thing to do is probably go get some work experience if you have not done so already BEFORE embarking on your PhD. NO, being a teaching assistant for an undergrad lab does not count, and NO just being a paid Researcher by your PI does not count. I mean go to a non-academic setting (which you have stated you would like) and see what the difference in culture is between doing science just to do science and get research grants & publications vs doing science to gain capital and profits. HUGE DIFFERENCE!!!!!!. NOBODY and I mean NOBODY wants to hire a PhD with no work experience in their field. If you do manage to get a job with your PhD with no work experience in that field you are either: that 0.01&#37; with great networking + LUCKY and hit the jackpot, or you will hate your life and regret ever wasting 5-6,7 years in getting your PhD. Getting a PhD without prior work experience in that field is almost career suicide in most cases, and if you did not graduate from a top 10 school good luck ever trying to land a Tenure Faculty position. I graduated from a mid-tier level school and 8/10 of the Tenure Faculty positions are from top 10 schools(MIT, Berkeley, Nortwestern, etc) for their PhD or Post-Doc.  As far as which PhD program offers better employability.... It really does not matter. It is more of the SKILLS you have gained that matters and what instrumentation + software's are you proficient in as each company is going to differ greatly in what they want. Example, a company isn't going to care if you have your PhD in Analytical or Biochem when all they are looking for is someone who has vast knowledge over Method Development + Validation using Mass Spec and whatever software they run such as Empower or MassLynx. Right now currently we are hiring an Analytical Chemist PhD level, but if someone with only a Bachelors in Chemistry that has 6-8 years of Method Development under their belt, they will be a good candidate. Versus a PhD level Analytical Chemist that doesn't even know how to use the software because they did their Thesis on something completely unrelated to the job they are applying for and have zero experience on it. Situation dictates and each scenario is going to differ greatly.   Personally, I would go with Bioanalytical Chemistry as it is a both sub-disciplines of Biochemistry + Analytical Chemistry. I am actually going to do my PhD in Bioanalytical Chemistry. Some quick pointers! Get to know as much mass spectroscopy as you can as it is the single most powerful analytical instrument in Chemistry, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology. Learn GCMS if you can but the MOTHER of them all to learn that will increase your employability is LCMS-MS Triple Quadro Polar. The best manufacturers for Mass Spec most used in industry is either Waters Acquity, Agilent, and Shimadzu; so try to get to play on those. Software's to learn are Empower and/or Mass Lynx. If you do not know any of this you will struggle in landing any type of Analytical Chemistry PhD level work whether its in proteomics, drug discovery, etc. As far as pure Biochemistry, the employability is really low and I would not do it. Learn Biochem on the go on your own time and just know that Analytical Chemistry is the most employable. Good luck in your future endeavors."

She was nervous when it went up, because she was flying in the face of what academia says you're supposed to do in tenure track (she claimed you shouldn't work 24/7), but the response was overwhelming supportive. I know of a number of really good academic CS blogs that have interesting takes on topics. It probably won't help you get tenure, but it's definitely not looked down on.  I plan to start with it mostly being selfishly about me. By that I mean that I want to use it to help me develop my writing style and work through concepts, rather than trying to achieve something specific with it.  One topic/area is documenting things I make, for fun or research, hardware and software. It's good practice to write down how you did something as you're doing it, both for your future self and others who might be trying to achieve the same thing. It's sort of like an informal lab notebook.  Another topic is writing out explanations of things I'm learning. There's the adage saying that you don't understand something unless you can teach it. Writing out a high level explanation for lay people (or at least scientifically inclined lay people) is a great way to prevent myself from getting lost in the weeds. Also good for developing my science communication chops.  Lastly, I want to write more general pieces -- op-ed style or sharing general information like tips on applying for fellowships. I really enjoy outreach and would like to get involved in policy a bit, so this is my space for thinking about connecting to things outside the lab, like ethics, policy, society, etc."

He has told me a great history of how terribly STI-Tech managed the award with a whole host of problems. It has been a huge headache for him. So the 2019 class can at least look forward to new management of the award because it seems difficult to do much worse of a job than STI-Tech has done the past two years.  My colleague said that STI-Tech typically wouldn't pay fall semester tuition until September, which is much later than the deadline for most schools I know of. STI-Tech was supposed to notify all of the institutions that this would be the case but sometimes they failed to do this. This caused a lot of annoying email exchanges and phone calls for my colleague. Everything worked out in the end, he did not have to pay any fees and his tuition got paid, but it was much more complicated than it needed to be and wasted a good bit of his time.  About three weeks ago I called the STI-Tech office and asked when they would be paying tuition and when I should expect to hear from them regarding how third party billing will be set up. They told me that they were going to send out an email about this by the end of that week... It's been three weeks and they never sent an email about any of that and now they are apparently not in charge of the award anymore. I don't know what to make of this either and I also plan to contact Systems Plus, Inc. sometime this week.  All in all I think everything will work out in the end but I'm sure it will be a pain in the ass for all the students. I think once the transition is completed hopefully things will be better but this first semester might be rough. In the mean time I think all of the NDSEG students that are on here should keep sharing whatever information we have. As far as advice I don't think I can provide any other than just send emails and make calls till they get their shit together."

This is a comment you WANT since they say several good things about your work before criticizing.     To handle this, you likely need to add a line in the introduction mentioning what others in the field have already found on this topic (and where the gap of knowledge is), and in your discussion where you compare your findings to other papers. Sometimes you confirm previous work and sometimes you contradict previous work. If you contradict someone else's paper, it is good to discuss why this may be (e.g. we used X instead of Y, changing the context of those findings).

I got interested in his research as an undergrad, as he was one of the only scientists on campus working in a somewhat niche but rapidly expanding field that I wanted to get into. I went to his office hours to introduce myself, and we ended up chatting for a bit about his research. By the end of the semester, we had spoken a few times, and I was pretty sure I wanted to join the lab as an undergrad volunteer.   I remember asking one of his TAs what he was like to work with, and I’ll never forget the response. The first word the TA used was “humble”. Not smart, not innovative, not funny, but humble. And that stood out to me. The TA, who I had a lot of respect for and who’s class I enjoyed, told me that the PI listened and was receptive to other people’s ideas and suggestions, that he was down to earth, and that he was easy to work with.   So fast forward, and I’ve been in this lab for about a year now. Sometimes my PI scares me, but I know that behind his intensity, he means well. He is receptive to feedback, and he lets us learn by making our own mistakes. Another grad student once told me that my PI was more likely to watch me struggle for 6 months that to come right out and tell me I was making a mistake. I know that’s not the ideal environment for everyone, but I am thriving under his guidance, and I have so much respect for him as a scientist and as a mentor.

Professors expect this to happen -- they've been through the process and know how it works -- and won't be offended if you don't end up working with them in the short- or long-term.   If you meet with them, make sure to ask what direction they want to move in over the next five-ish years! You and your advisor need to have a strong mentoring relationship independent of the content of the science, but it's also important that you guys have the same vision for the scientific direction of your thesis work. I rotated with one PI who was  trying to wrap up their work in my topic and move on to something else, and was trying to make me move in that direction, too."

A methodology is a given approach to research, specifically its epistemological and ontological commitments to knowledge production. A method is a specific technique used to produce knowledge and it needs to align with the methodology. So, action research is a methodology and participant observation could be a method one uses in such a study.   Qualitative research is a very broad, and sometimes contested, term that generally refers to any research that produces knowledge in ways that do not rely on numbers (e.g., statistics). Ethnography is largely considered to be one of the first qualitative methodologies, and through it emerged a set methods (e.g., participant observation) that are now used in other qualitative methodologies (e.g., action research)."

I’ve tried other citation managers (Zotero, Mendeley, others) and found none of them completely replace what I can do in EndNote. I do maintain a Zotero library for my research group, since it’s free. It’s OK, but nothing that would make me want to switch.

I would be happy to provide you with a quote and a sample edit but I would be hesitant to do much without seeing the comments on both your paper and your presentation. I'd also want to make sure we had a solid plan going forward and would hope that your advisor could be looped in on the plan or reviewing each chapter, because I wouldn't want you to waste a bunch of money and turn in a nice paper that would just be rejected because of content. We can talk about what to include and work on strategies for writing and organizing but there's only so much help I can offer with content, since my expertise is in clarity, commas, and cohesiveness (and APA style, and semicolons and blah blah blah) not arts education. I can point out areas that don't make sense and make sure you follow a theme and prove points... anyways, if you're interested, let me know. Other good places to find editors are the Editorial Freelance Association or ACES The Society for Editing. There are some other associations as well. What's nice about those is that the members are usually at least lightly vetted for editing experience so you know you'll get an experienced member and you can search for experts in certain types of editing, like academic/dissertation editing and some might even have an arts focus."

That process helped a lot with breaking \"researching/writing\" down into much more manageable tasks.

(It will look better if you can publish, but there's no point in accumulating stress about it unless you are required to do so.)  Do you have enough statistical power in your data to claim negative results? Convincingly demonstrating that something does not work is difficult, but valuable, even if people don't get excited about it.  My program generally advises people to stay a year or two longer if it yields a PhD or an additional publication; the post-doc clock starts immediately, and is limited by universities and major funding institutions in my field to prevent interminable post-docs.  I also have a complicated, messy data set without crystal clear results.  I am struggling with how to build a dissertation out of what I have. I have learned that one's dissertation need not be \"publishable\" although that does make the process easier. It does have to be based on the work of the author (as in, one cannot staple in a 4th author publication, but the contribution to that work can be incorporated).  I was recently able to get my PI's attention and discuss what the chapters of my dissertation might look like, and he provided some useful insights. He indicated that writing up what I have spent my time on is a viable option, even if it is not publishable (or not publishable in a high class journal, or is only publishable in a methodological journal). We are supposed to be learning how to independently conduct research, so the lack of feedback is somewhat expected, but you might find it helpful to speak to others who have graduated, take a thesis workshop, etc.  My department coordinator set up a meeting with me to help me find resources to graduate. Maybe your department can also help you find guidance outside your committee.  An overly ambitious project that I can show is technically feasible will become a technical chapter in my dissertation; I plan to explain how one could actually do the project by modifying some aspects of the design to greatly speed up the data collection process. I spent a lot of time on this, but it just didn't yield a scientific result because the project was poorly designed. Ironically, my PI's attitude towards this project changed from enthusiastic to negative over time, but he still wants me to include it.  Although I get very frustrated and negative about my situation at times, I keep trying to remind myself of positive interpretations. My data was collected under inconsistent circumstances beyond my control, which is less than ideal. However, whatever I do find should be fairly robust due to that inconsistency. Also during this analysis and result-searching process, I continue to learn new and interesting things, which is something I enjoy (despite being annoyed that I would prefer not to conduct science this way). Furthermore, as I am interested in maybe pursuing data science as a career, finding a few useful stories in my data seems like a valuable training exercise, which will make a good story about overcoming adversity and finding value in a mess for later.  One student in my program discovered after 5 years, that all his data was noise due to faulty equipment. He graduated 2 years later after even more research without the noise problems, although his mental health suffered a lot.  As a last resort, you might be able to reform your committee and even switch labs and get a new mentor. After an advisor in my program basically ruined the life of his nearly finished grad student (by abruptly rescinding the position, and therefore the visa, of this student's lover roommate and fellow lab mate), this student was allowed to transfer to another lab and finish. Rebuilding the committee is a fairly nuclear option, but it might be possible (although you mentioned below that this might be problematic -- at my school in this circumstance, the recommendation is to speak to the dean of students, who hopefully is not an old drinking buddy of your PI).  You might also write a draft of a paper and give it to the PI. Publishing more is better, and it is harder to say no to a manuscript than a nebulous plan. Finding famous people who have published things in less-than-stellar journals might also lubricate the process, in case your PI's ego is in the way of a lower tier publication.  A workshop I attended suggested looking up dissertations from prior lab members. This can provide an idea of what the PI considers acceptable for graduation. (If you have never read a dissertation before, it is worth doing. Some of them are surprisingly rough.) We have a ProQuest database of dissertations on our campus."

After WPI I went to brown for my ms and I had far more practical lab skills than some of my peers from other schools.   At the same time, the graduate program is simply not a priority at WPI. All of the aspects that sets them apart are focused on the undergrad experience. I also know they are going through a bit of turmoil right now with their president and the treatment of professors with many having already quit and others searching for jobs because the school is in massive debt to fund its seemingly annual expansion projects.   That being said, the name also carries clout in the field of robotics (I believe they were the first school in the country to offer a robotics program) and especially in New England.

If not it definitely is possible to have minimal debt, by working and applying for outside scholarships. I have loans for undergrad and grad school but I kept them at a minimum and each time I take out a loan I have calculated what percentage of my monthly salary (with a starting salary) will go towards said loans. I’ve kept that monthly payment very doable to still save money etc. I have loans and it sucks but also for my degree I need to go to grad school and funded positions for multiple years can be few and far between so loans were just a reality."

But if you can lock in a low interest rate then debt is more of an investment really, its not such a bad thing.

I knew I'd have an RA position, so tuition was covered, but the stipend was almost nothing (I think it was like 2K per semester or something). I took about 25k of loans for my first year of school, and then I got one of the university's research fellowships for my final four years that included a live-able stipend. Those four years were tight, money-wise, but I didn't need additional loans. I actually ended up only using three years of the fellowship, and then I got a full-time job outside the university during my dissertation writing phase. I had also gotten married while in grad school, so between the income for my full-time job and my husband's income, we paid off my school loans in something like 9 months.   Anyway, I guess loans aren't ideal, and I'd definitely advise everyone to think really carefully and realistically about them before deciding, but I think it worked out fine for me. For a variety of reasons (some of them to do with the economy, some of them to do with me making me naive decisions), the only job I could get between 2011 and when I started grad school in 2014 was as a barista at Starbucks. Even though I was living with my parents and didn't pay for rent *or* groceries (I know, I know), it would have taken me years to save up the 10-15k you have. I can't even imagine (don't want to) what my life would be like if I had waited three more years to start grad school, but I definitely do NOT regret starting with so little saved.

I'm starting in the fall so I may not be the best person for advice, but I come from a similiar background with no financial safety net. Once I knew I was getting in, I rolled back my retirement contributions and started saving significantly. I also took stock of all recurring charges (subscriptions and such). I cancelled the unnecessary ones, looked for student rates for the ones I wanted to keep, and I plan to call and see if I can get a better deal for everything else. Luckily, I do live with my girlfriend, so that cuts down on shared costs a bit. I've had a recurring budget spreadsheet going for a few years now, so I just worked out reductions across the board where I could. Nothing that put me in a tough situation, though. Just eating in more than I like to.   In actuality, I realized that after taxes, I'm going to be making more a year from this base stipend than I made at my first job out of college in my field (Psych Degree, Behavioral Pharmacology Research at John's Hopkins, $29,500), so it's not really that bad. I'm lucky in that almost all of my remaining student loans are subsidized and federal, so after I factor in not paying those every month (and not worrying about interest), not paying for benefits, and the additional tax breaks I get, the money that I get to put in my pocket isn't going to be that much less than what I make now doing research ($48,500 before taxes). Of course, my benefits are going to be way worse, but ya take what you can get."

I didn't pay it because I do not owe it.  When you move in, you will be given a form to fill out in which you are to document the condition of the apartment when you move in. I would go over every inch of that apartment in explicit detail and note every crack, scratch, wear mark, stain, discoloration, and anything that is not otherwise pristine and perfect. You might need additional paper, because the form they give you does not often include enough space. If you have to send it back to them in physical form, go to the post office closest to you and send a certified letter. This will require someone to sign for it and you will get a receipt, so they cannot claim they never received it because you have a receipt showing that the Post Office delivered it to their mailing address, and someone signed for it.  While you are doing this, take pictures of everything and then send them to yourself. Save them in a dropbox folder or something so there is at least one backup location.  As far as what happens when equipment is not repaired, put in work orders and call the office. You'll need to check your local laws, because in some places, residents can pay for a third party to perform services and then bill the landlord. I had a roach infestation in my apartment because the next door neighbors were hoarders, but the landlord took forever to send an extermination team out there. It was only after I threatened to call an exterminator myself and then deduct the cost from my rent that they sent someone out immediately. Work orders and follow up emails are a paper trail, so if they fail to repair things that could impact the living conditions of the apartment (i.e. heat is out for an extended period of time in winter) then that would help you in the long run. If you're worried about dirtying the carpet, you can buy plastic placemats or rugs on amazon for relatively cheap. Because of my experience, I'll never live in an apartment with carpet again.  Your landlord also just can't refuse to return the deposit. They must notify you regarding the reason they are withholding your deposit. If the reasoning is not justified, or you have evidence to the contrary, you can probably sue them in small claims court, but this can be a long process and you should make sure the evidence is in your favor before pursuing this route.  You should also not be afraid to discuss problems you're having with professors you become close to, because they might know something or know someone to talk to. That's how I found out about a tenant resource center in my town.  &#x200B;  Edit to add: If the walls are white and you put nails in the walls, get a paint scraper and some white toothpaste and fill in the holes with toothpaste and just scrape the excess with the paint scraper."

I get a stipend of $25k for the 9 months, and then I get stipend(s) during the summer that try to match what I make usually in a month. This past year I made around ~33k in stipends. For federal taxes I paid around ~$2.5k, and for DC I'd say it was around $1.5k. For the DC taxes I had some relief because there's a little thing about rent you pay during the year and how much you make (if your tax filing unit makes under ~$50k a year etc etc). So I don't know exactly what you'll have to be being in a different state and all, but for reference you can see it as \"another grad student in DC is making ~$30k in stipends, pays $3-4k in taxes\".

I'd do a little research on the Tampa area to make sure you're comfortable with the commute times, areas within your price range in relation to distance from school, etc. Tallahassee is pretty quick and easy to get around, not to mention fairly inexpensive, where Tampa may not be depending on where you live in relation to USF.  Second, are either offering funding? If so, how much? How is tuition in comparison? Less debt is often better.  Third, and probably most important (especially if you're expecting to take on significant debt) is: how's the job placement after school? If the placement rates are about the same into similar-prestige positions, than the cheaper option is probably better. If one costs more but results in better jobs/jobs more to your taste/jobs that pay better, than that needs to be taken heavily into consideration. You can often find statistics on this on websites or by (tactfully) asking for statistics from department administrators."

I would personally feel uncomfortable with six figures of debt and a PhD, which may or may not pay a salary that would allow me to pay off the debt easily.  I would think long and hard what your career goal is and if the PhD is needed for that.  There are a few things I thought about before going back to for my PhD: earning potential, debt, and retirement.  I'm in a very different field, but overall, while you're doing a PhD, that's at least half a decade of lost earning potential that you could have gotten with a full-time job.  Also, during those years, you will not be able to contribute to an employer matched retirement fund, and may or may not be able to contribute to an IRA.  And, you are debt-free right now, so you don't need to worry about interest piling up on existing student loans while they're in deferment.  Ultimately, it's up to you whether this debt load is worth it for the intellectual challenge and possibly a college-level teaching gig."

As somebody who has done three hours a day on public transportation to get to class before... absolutely do not do that if you can avoid it. It is super draining, and in grad school, time is your most important resource. The 30% rule is meant to be a benchmark of sorts and doesn’t really work for all situations (particularly city living). I would also maybe put off saving for retirement at the level you planned here if you can swing it. I don’t get any retirement benefits from the university like matched contributions but I try to throw a few hundred dollars a year into my Roth IRA. It’s not a ton but it’s more than nothing, and it’s really all I can swing at this point.

I got my B.A. last year and took this past year off because I felt burned out and needed a break. I also didn't want to pile on grad app stress onto my senior year, so that's another benefit to taking a gap year to consider.   Academically, you sound like you would be a solid candidate, so I don't think taking a year off would hurt your application. If anything, I think taking a year off, in giving you some more time to work on your applications, might be helpful (especially in giving you time to study for the GRE). It's also good to go in with a plan for how to continue building on your relevant experience in that year. For me, that meant taking on a job building from my tutoring/teaching experience, and presenting at a conference, which wasn't a lot, but both were good outlets for me to do what I'm passionate about.   Financially, I'm very glad I took a year off to have a chance to save money for a future move and grad app fees - though you should definitely look into fee waivers for your application fees and GRE. When it comes to school visits, I would echo what another commenter mentioned - there's a good chance that there will be a Welcome Weekend type event for a program you get into, and they usually cover plane fare, etc.   When it comes to saving (and I didn't quite realize this in the past year), there are some things you may want to keep in mind for a potential move. This depends on where you end up, so some of these things may not apply for you (I'm moving across the country for my program):   * security deposit for an apartment  * plane ticket/traveling costs  * a decent suitcase  * shipping costs  * first month's rent/expenses   I've been able to save for most of these things, and I'm thankfully not worried about my first month thanks to my parents agreeing to give me a small loan, but I know a friend in my cohort is struggling with moving expenses.
