Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) usually have a good shot at thwarting this if trained with “robust” enough data, wherein a discriminative network would output a probability of the picture being real vs fake and the generative network would generate pictures. This is vastly over simplified, but in there somewhere probably lies advanced techniques that could be used in certain circumstances to identify and thus combat the validity of deep fakes in a large media frenzy. Plus, I would imagine the creator of a deep fake that leans on the side of defamation would be subject to lawsuits and other legal action, which is probably preventing a lot of what you are talking about.

32,How do big websites check if a email address or user already exists?,"Another possible way, especially for extremely large databases, is to use a Bloom filter as a first step. The Bloom filter can quickly conclude whether the user 1) is definitely not in the database or 2) *may* be in the database. Only in the latter case you need to actually do the expensive data base lookup to be sure. "

So I think you are already well prepared. As the others mentioned, do not be overwhelmed and take things one at a time. Do not snob math, especially if things like Machine Learning/AI sound interesting to you.

This is so that no one server is working harder than another and they are ""balanced"" in workload.

Object detection is one of most common tasks in Computer Vision. We expect detector to be as accurate as possible as well as fast enough to run in real time. These two aspects have a trade-off and most of the detectors have proven to be doing well only on one metric, either the accuracy or the speed. Generally, more accurate detectors have found to be more compute demanding which is not the ideal scenario, especially when we are looking for more and more efficient models.

It seems you've just ""found"" the magic number of lines your computer can process in approximately one second. In fact, if you actually timed your program with more precision, you'd most likely find that it would not finish in exactly the same amount of time each run (ex: 1.005 seconds, 1.013 seconds, 1.008 seconds, etc).

Your modem or router is the one that decides which local computer is going to receive that packet.

Web browsers are different, you download the sites page, and the browser scans and parses the HTML in order to create elements to render inside of the browser window. You don’t need a web browser to use the internet much like you don’t need internet to use a web browser (local site or IIS).

136,P vs NP and NP hardness and NP completeness,"P does not necessarily mean that you can find a solution quickly, it just means that the amount of time to solve the problem only grows at most a constant exponent of your input.  For given input n the solution will take O(n\^k) time as opposed to O(k\^n)

The P stands for Polynomial

The N in NP means non deterministic, it does not mean Not P.

Compare for a data set that goes from 2 to 100 items.  As n grows the NP solution time grows horrifically fast.

P     2\^5, 10\^5, 100\^5 vs

NP  2\^5, 2\^10, 2\^100

All problems that are P are NP in that P is a subset of NP.  Think P = Polynomial time, NP = non deterministic Polynomial time.  One of the aspects of NP problems is you can verify a solution in polynomial time.  If a problem has a polynomial time solution then verifying the solution can be done worst case polynomial time.

For example assume I have an algorithm that finds all the prime numbers from 1 .. n and it has a run time of O(n\^k).  If the number 534,343,534,343,534,343 is  in the range 1..n I can guarantee to test if it is prime within polynomial time.  Worst case I can just use the algorithm I used to find all the primes which I know is bound by O(n\^k).  This is why all P problems are a subset of NP problems.  The reverse may be true but we don't know that yet (this is the P = NP problem) "

You'll perhaps be looking at jobs like software development, IT, system administration, the list goes on. But your question shows you really haven't given this much thought or research on your own. "
142,Am I really learning something?,">usually I just get a crazy idea, and start coding it, googling how to do some stuff, then I just adapt the code to my situation and thats it

Yeah, that's software engineering. That's the reason why so many companies lean into extensive testing.

You're right on track. I would tell interviewers ""This is my first job so I don't have a good metrics scale to measure my knowledge, but I haven't found a problem yet, that I couldn't solve with a bit of research. ""Using your resources"" is a golden phrase to use in interviews. 

Yes you are learning things. It took me a while to realize this, but every one knows a lot about a little. What I mean is, when you struggle with something, research it, find an answer and then apply it, you won't forget how you did it. Sure, you may forget language syntax or whatever, but you'll know how to solve the problem. When some one comes by and asks you for help on the same issue, you'll have advice to give right? That's you learning. The more times you struggle and Google stuff, the more you learn.

Software Engineering, programming, coding, whatever you want to call it, it isn't comprehensive. No one knows all of it. Let me give you an example. I'm the new guy on my team. Not only am I fresh out of college and need to learn how software is developed in the real world, I have to learn my company's products, design process, etc. I feel dumb literally everyday. Then last Tuesday there is this big ""Out of memory"" issue. Everyone scrambled and tried to figure out what server could sacrifice some memory to this process that was failing (data processing). I stepped up and told them that the heap memory wasn't full, rather the old generation ratio wasn't large enough. That if we adjust the NewRatio Java opts variable, the process should complete just fine. Seasoned engineers looked at me like I was a genius when my solution worked. Am I a genius? Hell no. I just so happened to write a research paper on Java garbage collection in my last semester of school. Out of the hundreds of things I don't know everyday, I did know this one thing.

When people say that getting into programming requires you to accept that you will spend the rest of your life learning, they aren't joking. If you aren't busy learning what's already out there, you'll be busy learning all the new technology that has yet to come out. "

153,What all will I be able to do with a computer science degree?,"I am retired now but got my BS, MS, and PhD in CS at different schools and my career included government, industry, and university professorship. I have even been a general agency-wide recruiter in my career. Computer Science (especially today) could better be named Computing Science. It is the study of computing and computing systems (including artificial intelligence). It includes the architecture and internals of computers, Operating Systems, networks, and the Internet because that gives one extra insight into computing solutions that can be applied elsewhere. A person with a CS degree might have a job writing code to process and summarize data, then analyzing the results to find patterns that lead to further development of software and/or systems that solve some problem or implement some application. A CS person might write code that gets inserted into non-computer hardware that need to be controlled or managed (such as GPS devices, printers, cars, farm equipment, telecom switches, robotic devices, graphics cards in a PC, etc) which we collectively call embedded systems. A CS person might work for a gaming company to develop games, but that may require additional art, graphics, and gaming background. A CS person might be hired to work primarily with databases or information systems (such as with insurance companies). A CS person might work on various parts of a website (front end and/or backend). Ones first job may involve quality assessment, preparing/analyzing data, or making cosmetic changes to a website, but one can look for promotions or movement within to other jobs. If CS is a minor or 2nd major then doors of opportunity can open up in non-tech areas too—at least it may result in getting an interview that the person without any CS doesn’t get. You might be perceived as someone who would be good on the team because you are smart and you have technical expertise. Having CS in the mix might make you more attractive going into medicine, nursing, healthcare, business, pharmaceutical, law, criminal justice,  or social work. A recruiter might simply want to grant an interview to hear your story— seeing strong CS credentials and wondering why an interest in a different industry. Always remember that coding or programming often is people oriented because you are creating something to help or entertain people. It is not computer-centric. A person often invents a computer solution to do something that he/she is bored doing the existing slow, tedious, or uninteresting way. So your CS knowledge will even help you be more effective when making a spreadsheet for some club or non-profit organization you may volunteer with. Bottom line— it can open doors to everything if you have the confidence to step through (or talk your way in). "

156,When and why do we use subnet mask?,"As the name implies, it creates sub-networks. All of your computers might be on one big physical network but you can logically divide them into smaller sub-networks that can then be firewalled off or whatever makes sense for operational or security reasons. Put important data in a special protected subnet away from your office machines that browse the internet for example. Makes sure computers in one subnet can't talk to ones in another subnet. It keeps things separated.

A mask is what enables you to tell if a specific computer is on a specific subnet. Computers are identified on the network by IP address (ok technically a MAC address too but let's focus on the IP layer which is where subnetting comes in). Often you see an IP address written as something like 192.168.42.1. but that's the human friendly decimal representation: the ""real"" IP address is in binary, sequence of 1s and 0s. In IPv4 (still the dominant network protocol I think but IPv6 is growing) the IP address is 32 bits so that means 32 1s and 0s are used to give a computer a unique ""name"". Usually the 32 bits are split into 4 8-bit groups called ""octets"" that are when written in decimal. That's why you see 192.168.42.1, each number between dots represents 8 bits so all together is 32 bits.

So how do you make a subnet? Well it makes sense to group IP addresses together based on some of the 1s and 0s being in common. Sort of like having a family name, you and family members like share the same family name but have a different person name (John Doe, Jane Doe are both in the Doe family but have different first names to tell them apart on paper).

So your subnet is kind of like a family name, all the computers on that subnet share the same ""name"" which in the case of binary means they share the same sequence of 0s and 1s at the beginning of their name.

The mask is therefore the thing that tells you which of the 32 bits is the ""family"" name (subnet, like Doe) and which are the first name (computer name on network, like John). The way it does this is that you write out all 32 bits of the IP but you put a 1 in every spot where that bit is part of the family subnet name and a 0 where that bit is part of the computer name. 32 is a lot to type out so let's use an example of an 8 bit IP address. If the first 5 bits are the family subnet name, then the last 3 bits must be the computer name. So the subnet mask is 5 1s representing the subnet + 3 0s representing the computer name = 11111000. If you wrote the binary into decimal, you'd get 248 so you might see the subnet mask written as 248... To make it a little more human readable but really it's the bits that are important.

It's become a lot more common to use CIDR notation instead or writing masks. CIDR is just writing the number of bits that are used for the subnet name, so in our example above of an 8 bit IP address with a 5 bit subnet name, then you'd write the subnet mask in CIDR as just /5. Slash, with number of bits, and you're done.

You could have /8, or /16 or /24 or /27 or whatever you want as a subnet mask. What's the difference between them? Well the bigger the subnet number, the more bits are used for the subnet, which means you can lots more unique subnet names. But there's less bits for unique computer names so you can have less computers on that network. So you need to pick a good subnet mask that allows you to have enough networks to do what you need while allowing enough bits for computer names to accommodate the number of computers that need to be on that subnet. It can be tough to estimate that especially in a rapidly growing company so that takes some thought and experience to get right.

Hope that helps! "

>Do electric charges themselves retain large chunks of information?

In a digital computer, each electrical charge retains exactly 1 bit of information. More precisely, each location where a charge may or may not be, retains 1 bit. It takes many bits together to retain a ""large chunk of information.""

When the same computer runs two different programs (at different times), the hardware is ""exactly the same"". The difference is which wires, or registers, are ""on"" or ""off"" (contain a charge or not). Software describes this aspect of reality -- the state of the bits. Hardware describes how the bits are wired together, and doesn't typically change during program execution. "

Industry level grammar forms sacrifice simplicity for expressiveness. Most of them, for instance, make it possible to define operator precedences, with which it is easier to write unambiguous grammars.

In my experience, many tools have their own grammar forms. To choose a tool for your need (compiler generator?) is to choose a form, which is almost always more useful than raw BNF. ANTLR is one example. "

Overall though, you don't really have to be that great at math to succeed in CS. You can make it really mathy if you choose, but you can also make it not so mathy. "
243,Death of Moore's law?,"Moore’s law is predicted to be dead for more than 20 years, but it is still valid these days. Developers keeps inventing new solutions to keep it alive. For example, the chiplet technology is bypassing the limitation. Strictly speaking, we should only count the transistors on each chip to verify the Moore’s law. But since all the chiplets are in a single product, why we cannot count a all of them.

Here is our paper that summarize not than 4000 CPUs and GPUs. You may see that the Moore’s law is still valid in figure 1. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11313.pdf "

Also beware of file permissions which might not get saved. "
247,Software Engineering a SaaS product with one db tenant or multiple db environments?,"If you need analytics data to be centralized, stream it out when its generated in the most read only way possible. That should spread and scale the load accordingly to the usage and give you what’s needed. You may also have per customer analytics - meaning a database and services per environment.

Remember containers are coming to stay and central databases becoming a anti pattern. Work around it. Your work should not dictate what others work should be. "

It is a highly active research area at the moment to convert between different homomorphic encryption systems which seems to be non-trivial.
So, I would say it is hard to find a fitting scheme (though probably not impossible). "

258,What makes OOP such an important programming paradigm in the SWE world?,"Overdoing OOP yields terrible results. Encapsulation is important concept. SOLID iterates over some nice code attributes which are attainable with classes/objects.

Other than that, ""composition over inheritance"" is a nice OOP limiting practice, multiple-inheritance can be a nightmare and some languages don't support it at all. Python with duck-typing seems perfectly usable without using many otherwise popular OOP patterns. "

265,Getting into backend dev,"Backend development mostly deals with writing code that read/write data to some datastore, access some cache etc. It is mostly about the mindset and the programming patterns that you  follow while designing/coding a backend app or service.

271,Do/did you regret your degree? Why or why not?,"Twenty+ year professional and I have no regrets getting my degree.  That doesn't mean it doesn't come with some disappointments, but it opens a wide range of opportunities, one can argue limitless.

I got a BS, then a MS and the university I went to focused their MS on pursuing a PhD....so a good deal of theory.  One can argue that doesn't translate into the real-world, and perhaps not directly, but it leaves you with an appreciation of the 'science' in Computer Science.  CS is more than just programming, it's foundation is in the academic pursuit of algorithms and logic, the purity of mathematics.  I left with an appreciation those that pursue 'pure mathematics' in the same way theoretical physics pursues a unified theory.  I'll never participate in either, but I have an appreciation of those that do.  University 'can' focus on the love of learning and I found it helpful to view some coursework in that manner.  I've not used Calculus since leaving college, but I still have an appreciation of understanding it (some time ago).  To this day I still wish I didn't have to take 'generals' and I don't feel they contributed to my professional or personal development, but /shrug/ price of admission for any degree.  I feel I left with a solid foundation for the profession, although I wish I had a deeper understanding of threading and distributed systems, but acquired that during the course of my career.

My career trajectory takes the brief form of: 1998-2011 software development of military weapons systems, 2011-2014 software architect/manager, 2014--current software contractor.  Primarily programming in an array of languages, \*nix embedded and backend systems, some data science related \*stuff. "

274,What really is the problem with sensor fusion in robotics and autonomous vehicles?,"It's important to grasp that the actual traction of humans efforts to create solutions for the worlds problems have and will fundamentally begin and end in software.
This is in contrast to many peoples perception that software is simply the glue which sticks the latest lidar sensor to the latest tensor stream processor.
The real issues that plague real software systems are as rampant as they are virilent. Even tech giants displaying best efforts have shown severe ongoing issues when it comes to actually sharing and layering technologies in a useful way (especially when those technologies represent complex sensory-model and or control-systems) Put short Sensor fusion is a pure software problem, it's very easy to do 'badly', but projects like Enfuse and Enblend show us how hard they are to do right, but also how proper tech usage for data fusion can be soo amazing! "
275,How large do the 2 prime numbers have to be for RSA encryption have to be to make it unfeasible for hackers to ever discover them?,"I feel like the questions from title and explanation are different.
To be sure that your RSA can't be cracked in the next years (not forever) by supercomputers you should use at least 1024 bits per prime, but if you can, 2048 better.

If you want to design purposely a system than can be cracked nor in seconds but also not in hours, it is very hard to determine. Because of the nature of RSA cracking 1 more bit doubles the average time, meaning that de difference between 20 bits and 30 bits is 1000 times longer.
For example, if 10 bits takes a minute, 20 bits will take 16 hours so fine-tuning so that it takes the amount of time you want even if it is not that specific, it is still hard.

The time will depend a lot on how fast is you cpu, what environment you are using and if you are using multiple threads.
My guess is that you won't be able to do more than 20 bit RSA cracking with a normal computer in less than 30 minutes, but again it highly depends.

You should just try it out, but don't set the bits on the upper bound and star lowering them, rather set the number of bits to 10 and increase them until you are satisfied with the time that it takes. "
276,"How do computer science phd programs work? Do you take courses the whole duration of your degree until graduation, or are a few years purely work (e.g. working at google on a project advised by PhD advisers)","In the US where the programs are typically 5 years, you will need to take about 2 years of courses. You are able to transfer credits if you have a Masters in relevant courses. Every program has its own specifics though.

I also fear that I under perform compared to my coworkers, which is, when I think about it now, expected since I'm a junior programmer. But I still worry about it.

289,Is this equation completely useless for computing? (c^2-b^2- a^2):(b*a)=,"First, I’d like to point out that it’s an expression, rather than an equation.  

For the first few things, it’s much easier, faster, and readable to write the original checks. Things like (a+b==c) are stupidly fast for a computer to do. Calculating squares and divisions, can be much slower, not to mention that your expression contains a lot more steps. Thus, your version was slower.

99.999% of the times, you don’t want to try to optimize these kind of basic math. That 0.001% are the times when 1) you are really good at low level programming, 2) you really need to squeeze that performance, and 3) there are constraints on the inputs that the compiler doesn’t know about, so it cannot generate the optimal code.

Your last example is weird, since you are still solving an equation, just a different one, and arguably a more complicated one. "
290,What is the definition of a primitive datatype?,"[Stack vs Heap](http://net-informations.com/faq/net/stack-heap.htm), is the easiest way to differentiate them.

This [visual sums](https://blog.penjee.com/passing-by-value-vs-by-reference-java-graphical/) it up nicely. "
291,Programming books/material,I know asking for material for coding is a very vague question since there’s a bunch of different things to take into factor. I dabbled very little in html and felt very bored. I have watched videos of the super basic python3. Since I haven’t done much it’s hard for me to say what I want to do or focus in on. Video games have always been a big part of my life and I would love to say that’s what I would want to get into. I know it’s all about what you enjoy and makes you happy but I want to have something to become successful in and not be irrelevant in the end.

294,Covid-19 Forecasting using SIER Model,"Part of the problem with making long term predictions for COVID is that it's highly tied to human behavior... and predicting human behavior is very tricky if not impossible.

For instance, how much will people continue to social distance over the next months?  How likely are they to wear PPE?  What about government response... we're in an election year and that is most likely impacting government responses and policy across the board.

On top of all of that we don't actually even know how many people are already infected.  How many more people are left to even infect at this point.  More studies like the one done in NY and in LA County, where they tried to test people at random for antibodies, are necessary to figure the infection numbers out.

If we don't have a clue as to how many people are left to infect... how can we predict if we'll head up or down from where we're at? "

296,Is the human brain a Turning machine?,"The brain has finite size and lives in a finite world that can only be measured with finite precision, so it is a finite state machine or part of one, depending how embodied or situated you believe cognition to be. It does have a ton of states, which allows it to do a decent impression of a Turing machine on the very smallest inputs, but we can demonstrate that it is not universal by imagining an input so large a human being could never finish reading it in one lifetime (the surface of the Earth under a microscope, for example).

300,How to estimate how many random characters a computer can generate per second?,"generation of a random number is the application of a formula repeatedly starting from a seed. there is a  math expression that generates the next number in the sequence from the previous number. it will be evaluated by the ALU in the form of a sequence of assembly level instructions (each one doing a minimal task like moving a number into a register or adding two registers together).

i dont know about super computers but in a personal computer (x86 architecture) the time required by an instruction in measured using the number of memory reads and writes required to finish the actions since they are the most expensive operations. each one of them takes 3 to 4 cycles.

thus knowing a bit about the target machine's instruction set and architecture and the math expression used in the number generator u could possibly calculate the number of cycles required to generate 1 number, then the number of numbers generated in 1 sec. but this is for each core. u could multiply by the number of cores if just separate threads are run each doing the same thing.

When right shifting it you will get 011 (3 in base 10).
Right shifting 6 (110) will give you the same. 

That's because the least significant bit (the first one on the right) is 1 when the number is odd, 0 when even. Right shifting removes this number so an odd number N and the even number N-1 will give the same result when right shifting. "

For example in college you might learn how to code in Java and how the language works, but in Uni they will teach you that as well as classes like data structures and algorithms which teach how to use efficient algorithms for certain tasks in programming. If you are just wanting to learn how to code college is a good start, but if you want to take more in depth courses Uni would be the place to go. Hope this helps. "

357,Is backward compatibility a big issue with c#?,"My thoughts is that it is difficult to make python 2 migrate to python 3 because of it being an interpreted language. I had a not fairly large python 2 code before and tried to run in python 3 and it was a mess. Most of the errors that python 3 can only found was ""print"" being in a wrong syntax and that was easy to fix. However, there are other details that changed as well specially on the differences on how Python 2 and Python 3 interprets a particular statement and you have to go and review the whole code where it went wrong.

I find C# on the other hand easier to migrate on code level because of it being a compiled language. Not much is going to change on the syntax. However if there are deprecated codes, it is easy to find because the compiler will find them for you and it saves a lot of time. "
358,"Hypothetically, if someone wanted to build a PC game with JUST C/C++, no big game libraries or engines, what would it take?","Hi, I am a hobbyist that has a game I am working on in Objective C. I have a post about its progress from yesterday in my history if your curious.   


I don't know what you mean about logos and corporate stuff on files? I don't know how your game would work, but in a typical game, its up to you what it displays. For an independent developer, let me put it this way - it is flat out stupid not to use a framework. Use Cocos2D or you can even do pygame.   


What I found when I started my project is that what I thought it was initially is very different from what it has become. Get to coding ASAP and working out ideas, then worry about stuff like ""is my code spooky?"" "

You have to learn how to break problems down and make a plan on how to solve them and think critically. "
361,What is the use of CS,"Think about what computer science even is. Its broad...... a lot broader than app development. Think of Uber, sure it's an app but its implication is a lot further reaching than just being an app.

25 years ago you could say ""Man, I wish that we could all drive each other around, instead of paying money to the Taxi companies."" There was no system for that, period. 

Then, over time, a bunch of technologies came along that made Uber possible. You've got GPS, mapping, wireless payments, online databases, programs that run on phones (which are powerful  computers but fit in your hand, screen and all!).  Those technologies, working together, cohesively made that concept possible.

Here's another example, KhanAcademy:

[https://www.khanacademy.org/](https://www.khanacademy.org/) 

Here's a guy (Salman Khan) who believed that people should have access to a quality education anywhere in the world, for free. So, in the form of streaming video, and the web itself, you can go and learn a variety of topics, in depth, for free. I used his classes to supplement my own college courses for years. I'd watch his lessons on a certain topic when I couldn't understand that same topic from my own professors.

If we are simulated, nothing implies the civilization simulating us is carbon-based, or that the laws of physics in their universe has anything to do with ours, so speculating on their technical abilities is pointless.

Trying to prove it right or wrong is impossible because we have no way of testing wether it’s true or false (unless a weird glitch in the matrix shows up). The existence of random processes in physics and nature doesn’t disprove it because there is no way to be sure a seemingly random process is not just an infinitely or arbitrarily long sequence of deterministic events.

371,Mechanical Vector Multiplication,"Not quite sure how to go about answering this mechanically myself. Answering a few clarifying questions might help someone more knowledgeable help you out:
1. The vectors being used “a” and “b” are each of the form, (x,y,z,w), where x,y,z, and w are integers 0-9?
2. Which approach to consider for dot product (i.e. multiplying magnitudes of each by cosine of angle between, or multiplying each corresponding element of vectors a and b, then summing)
-depending on the size of the device I imagine it would be easier to disregard angles and focus on elements of each vector.

386,Managing disks by two Operating systems,"When you do a hybrid shutdown (""fast boot""), Windows 10 closes your running applications, logs you out and then hibernates (writes relevant parts of RAM to disk). This way it doesn't have to load the kernel, drivers and then start various services on the next boot, as that would involve extra work and checks .

When you boot, it can just copy the contents of the hibernation image right back to RAM, and most drivers and services will barely notice that there was a shutdown. This has a drawback however, as almost everything has to be the same as it was, including the state of the disk. When you are running Windows and a file is open for writing by a driver/service, there is no way in hell that a user (or even administrator) could touch that file. Or just system files in general. But while you're on Linux, you can freely poke in them as Windows isn't there to enforce its rules. Allowing you to mess with the contents of the NTFS drive like that would allow you to ruin a consistency and continuity everything is relying on, easily leading to blue screens of death when a driver or service finds something unexpected. Since it is basic software engineering policy not to trust the user, they simply don't allow you to fuck up.

A computer science degree is not solely designed to teach you professional skills, it is designed to teach you computer science. Learning about areas such of these is part of gaining a strong grounding in mathematics and the foundations of computer science, and even those areas more closely related to programming.

What about your classmates that are aspiring theoreticians? I suspect they enjoy and value learning about these topics, and would moan if every course was industry-oriented. They would be right to, also, because a computer science degree is not a software engineering degree. "

You artificially give the advantage to yellow by giving the impression that yellow and green are equally represented when in reality green has far more results. (Please forgive the simplification)

Interesting article, but flawed. I firmly oppose the political rhetoric of the US. If changes should be made to the way search results are presented, it should be to filter inaccurate information not try to equally represent opinions. "

Smartphones and social media play a tremendous role in shaping an individual's worldview - as such, we need to be conscientious of what that's promoted to the top, beyond just user engagement.

I think it's important for engineers to be able to discuss ethical issues with their creations, not just product people. The engineers understand how their applications actually work and can be better equipped to discuss how a feature may be misused, biased, or otherwise harmful. "

Abstract

General-purpose computers have become ubiquitous and important for everyday life, but they are difficult for people with paralysis to use. Specialized software and personalized input devices can improve access, but often provide only limited functionality. In this study, three research participants with tetraplegia who had multielectrode arrays implanted in motor cortex as part of the BrainGate2 clinical trial used an intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) to control an unmodified commercial tablet computer. Neural activity was decoded in real time as a point-and-click wireless Bluetooth mouse, allowing participants to use common and recreational applications (web browsing, email, chatting, playing music on a piano application, sending text messages, etc.). Two of the participants also used the iBCI to “chat” with each other in real time. This study demonstrates, for the first time, high-performance iBCI control of an unmodified, commercially available, general-purpose mobile computing device by people with tetraplegia.

The success of a film is usually measured through its box-office revenue or through the opinion of professional critics; such measures, however, may be influenced by external factors, such as advertisement or trends, and are not able to capture the impact of a film over time. Thanks to the recent availability of data on references among movies, some researchers have started to use citations patterns as an alternative method for ranking movies. In this paper, we propose a novel ranking method for films based on the network of references among movies, calculated by combining four well known centrality indexes: in-degree, closeness, harmonic and PageRank. Our objective is to measure the success of a movie by accounting how much it has influenced other movies produced after its release, from both the artistic and the economic point of view. We apply our method on a subset of the IMDb (Internet Movie Database) citation network consisting of around 47,000 international movies, and we derive a list of films that can be considered milestones in the history of cinema. For each movie we also collect data on its year of release, genres and countries of production, to analyze trends and patterns in the film industry according to such features. We also collect data on 20,000 directors and almost 400,000 performers (actors and actresses), and we use the network of references and our score of movies for evaluating their career, and for ranking them. Since the IMDb dataset we employ is highly biased toward European and North American movies and personalities, our findings can be considered relevant principally for Western culture.

Surely the exact opposite is true?  As something becomes more disordered, 
the number of bits of information needed to describe it increases – “information grows”. 

To find structure we need to throw away information. A common simple example is 
summarising a large number of observations in a sample with a single number, by 
calculating the sample mean. The reason we calculate the sample mean is 
fundamentally that the entropy of the mean is lower than the total entropy of the 
original set of  observations.  Throwing away information (aka entropy) is what living 
things need to do both to preserve their own biological structure and also as part of 
trying to discern structure in their overly information-rich environment.

Its true that there is something that is hard to grow and preserve against the tendency 
to increasing disorder, but wouldn't it be better to find a different name for it 
than “information” ? That term is already commonly used to quantify something quite 
different - the relatively disorderly raw material from which order is excavated.  "

If incoming energy is absorbed by the circuit, that represents a ""0"" in the computer's binary code, and if the chip reflects the energy, that represents a ""1."" The switch mechanism uses very little power and enables the fast transfer of information between a wearable device and another kind of technology capable of receiving the data. The researchers say they were challenged by the fact that the chip in the wearable device needs to differentiate between the real Wi-Fi signal and the reflection from the background. They solved this problem by developing a wireless silicon chip that constantly senses and suppresses a background reflection, enabling the Wi-Fi signal to be transmitted without interference from surrounding objects.

595,Centralized vs Decentralized Networks,"You cannot say that one is more efficient than the other. It will always depend on whats  the application of your server, how the data/task are distributed amongs the server and what's the consensus protocol level.

But I can already tell you that distributed is mainly used by the majority of big compagnie (Oracle, Google ect) because it is definitely more efficient and it scales a lot better with huge data.

There are multiple reasons distributed is the viable solution:
- you can distribute the data around strategic location, so if the main server is in USA but one of the yt video is viral in France, it would be a lot better to keep it on a European server.
- having everything on one server forces is not viable when you have million of user, the network on the server side will quickly become a bottleneck. Having multiples server allows to split the connections on different location and not surcharge a the server bandwidth.
- if the task is heavy and can be parallelized you can multiply the processing speed by the number of servers you have (kind of). This can work for huge database, example if you search for all people named ""Bob"". Server 1 could search for Bob on the first half of the data and server 2 on the second half.

This is over simplified and in practice distributed servers is way more complicated and behave way differently for every application, but I hope I was clear enough and that I didn't say anything wrong. "

That means if you only have 1 core it takes 1600 minutes, if you have 100 it's 16 minutes.

>I processed 100 samples using 1 core -> 1600 minutes from above this means that processing 1 sample n 1 core takes 16 minutes

Formally:

    samples
    ------- = time
     cores

If you have more cores and same samples, it takes less time.

If you have more samples and same cores it takes more time.

If you want to speed up you either need to increase the core cunt or decrease the samples.

&#x200B;

>How many cores/year does it equal to? This question does not make much sense

I am not sure how to understand this question. Do you mean: how many cores do you need if you want to process 100 samples in exactly one year?

&#x200B;

>If i want to do 40000 samples in the same amount of time( just for the sake of the example) do I just multiply the cores week computed in (1) by 400 to get the required cores/year?

I assume the same amount of time refers to the 160 minutes you mentioned before in this case  cores / year does not make any sense at all.

No offence (I'm sure I'll get downvoted anyway) but if this type of question is troublesome for you then Computer Science might not be the right science for you.

While you're doing that, you'll realize you need to add css to accomplish some of what you envisioned for that layout (centering stuff, for example), and you'll be switching between the 2. After that, once you start adding some JavaScript, you'll want to go back and change some stuff in the core layout, so you'll go back alternating HTML/CSS. 
Start with HTML, and you'll soon realize that it will be intuitive when to pick up each tool, it's scary to start, but once you get it going, it'll be smooth sailing.

You need a coil and capacitor at the resonant frequency the tag operates at, along with some simple driver like a FET connected to a microcontroller to generate a PWM to get thr LC to resonate.

Detecting the tag modulating the magnetic field is another whole story. Even with really good RF design and a decent operating environment the modulation depth is only a few percent at short distances and rolls off at quite rapidly. At best I've only ever managed about 20mm read range for passive tags. "

Conveniently standard ASCII fits into these 8 bits (values 0-127) however, this leaves values 128-255 unused. This is where extended ASCII comes in. Extended ASCII uses up the remaining values of the byte to “extend” standard ASCII with more symbols.

This is why both standard ASCII and extended ASCII are able to occupy the same amount of space. "

You can find a lot on scribd.com, I’d suggest a subscription for a few months to get what you need as you start brainstorming for your research. 

Python is a solid language for implementation. Most things can be done very easily with numpy arrays, there are a lot of built-in functions in scipy as well. I’ve implemented a 2D finite difference explicit heat flow simulation just using array slicing in less than 100 lines of code. Practically useless, but the REPL of Python is very useful for debugging these types of things. And if you need more speed, you can get C or FORTRAN like performance using numba. Avoid Matlab, it’s really a hole you can go deep into but sees very little use professionally, and I’ve spoken with multiple PhD engineers who wish they had used Python or C++ instead. "
651,Need help finding a post- handwriting (in the air) to text using CV,
652,"[question] can I write an ""exe"" program to run on all x86 64 bit platform, regardless of OS.","Yes and no. No, in that a lack of 'import os' does not mean that you aren't using the os. Even starting a process (like the one your code runs in) is an operating system function. Storage is managed by the operating system. Memory management in modern systems is done by the operating system.

Even the compiled formats themselves differ - ELF on Linux, PE/COFF on Windows, Mach-O on MacOS, and a host of other formats that are either historical or simply used by uncommon platforms.

The typical approach to all this is to build for each platform the scaffolding required to run programs. This means you'll generate a Windows build, a Linux build, a MacOS build, and builds for any other platforms you want to target.

For interpreted (or interpretable) languages like Python, that will also mean that you can create operating system-specific builds of the interpreter. 'apt install python3' will install a different binary from 'brew install python', or from 'choco install python'. This does, however, mean that the different python runtimes can execute the same python scripts.

Another approach would be to throw out the operating system altogether. There are two approaches to this - the first is to bundle your application with a stripped-down operating system. There are a number of projects out there to help you build these, but you do need to put in more thought than just choosing a target platform. You can read up on Unikernels to follow this path deeper. Note that supporting actual hardware with this approach can be painful.

The second approach is even more minimal - to write your application to directly drive the hardware. That is, your application doesn't just add AX to BX (though it does to that at some point), you are actually controlling physical hardware states directly from your own code. If your goal is to run everywhere, though, you're likely to die of old age before you finish handling all of the hardware your program will see, so I can't really recommend this approach.

So yes in that it is theoretically possible to target the x86 hardware directly, no in that it is generally not a feasible option. "

661,Does the R language just constitute of functions?,"R is intended to be a functional programming language if that’s what you mean. I don’t think that’s what you mean and there is much more to it than just some base library packages that contain functions. 

Just like any language there is an R way of solving problems and once you get the feel for that you’ll write better code but you really ought to understand a lot of concepts about the language to effectively use it. For starters one should learn about all the base objects used in the language and the three most common OOP systems in R (S3,S4 and R5). Then you might want to choose a data structure library you like and learn how that community uses those tools. One of the most popular library collections is the tidyverse. After that learning some functional programming concepts would be helpful and naturally that requires understanding R environments. If you’ve mastered those things you can use R to do a lot. 

I know quite a few PhD statisticians (R is more statistics leaning btw) that don’t make any of their own objects and seem to use a small subset of what R is capable of. However, they often have sprawling code bases that are hard to manage and they rewrite the same code a lot.

663,Why is this time complexity O(total*n)?,"Using memoization, with the key as ""total:i"" the max amount of keys is total*n since i <= n. The memo table could only be filled after total*n calls. In the hypothetical worst case, the final ""else:"" block would be called for each key and each call would envoke two calls to dp. That gives you total*n*2 so far. And I am assuming the +1 is added to account for the initial call to do from the other function. 

Since big-oh is an upper bound, this worst case must be considered. Also in big-oh notation the lower order terms, such as +1, and the constants, *2, are ""dropped out"" which is why it is O(total*n). "

689,Turing Recursive Definition vs General Perception,"The first usage is old-fashioned, and dates back to the era when computability theory was called recursion theory, and similarly computable functions were called recursive functions. For the most part the field has moved away from that terminology but some textbooks still do it the old way (such as your textbook) .

Note that even if some text were to use the word recursive in both meanings, one should be able to understand which is meant by understanding what type of things they're talking about: the meaning where recursive=computable is a property of (some) mathematical functions, whereas the latter sense of recursive is a property of code/algorithms (which might implement a given mathematical function). Thus for example addition of integers and the factorial  are recursive functions in the sense that they are computable, and some particular implementation of one of them might or might not be recursive in the sense that it calls itself. So as long as you can figure out whether the text is talking about a mathematical function or of some code implementing one, you'll know what recursive means in that context. "

691,What is the role of FIRRTL? I've been working with Chisel and I don't quite get what happens behind the scenes.,"I'm not familiar with GCC internals, but FIRRTL intermediate representation (IR) is analogous to LLVM IR. The only difference here is that FIRRTL IR represents synchronous, digital circuits and LLVM IR represents programs.

Very, very high level view: when you start with C, the clang front end is converting this to LLVM IR. The LLVM IR is then transformed, optimized, and lowered in the middle end. Finally, a back end converts the LLVM IR to machine code. This canonical 3-stage compiler is super nice because it lets you abstract away shared infrastructure (if you build a new CPU instruction set architecture, e.g., RISC-V, you only need a new backend; if you develop a new programming language you only need a new front end) and it lets users hack on the compilation process by writing new transforms that get injected into the middle end.

With this in mind, Chisel is the front-end, the FIRRTL compiler is the middle end, and the FIRRTL compiler's Verilog emitter is the back end. "

703,Starting CS from scratch,"All of programming is fundamentally the same. It's logic and structure to give random assortments of data meaning. So when you look at all the different languages and techniques, the best thing to do is not to be scared of them, but to remember they all work to this goal. Along with this, remember that all of programming is made by people as opposed to physics that is dictated by nature. Not every concept will have a nice meaning and you'll encounter things that don't make sense until you see them enough.

A little more practical, pick a language that is forgiving to begin with. You can adapt almost all code into any language, but some are nicer than others. These are organized from high to low level. The lowest is machine code. 1's and 0's whose meaning is dictated by the instruction set. And the highest level is something like html or java. I recommend starting at high-level and going down. Python and Java are pretty smart and can be nice to beginners, while something like C is going require you to have a lot of knowledge and be a diligent programmer to make good work.

The ""modern"" OSes we use today isolate the loaded code from the physical hardware via several layers of translations. In fact, most executables are built as ""relocatable"" code sections specifically for that reason. At any moment the OS may physically relocate any code section, modify the code's physically mapping address registers, then continue processing. The programs themselves never see or even know any address translation is occurring. 

However, for some hardware - like certain microprocessors commonly used as Arduino targets without any significant OS that performs such memory address translations - the addresses a program references are exactly the same as the physical address. This is also true for certain data processing systems that must be certified for critical processing (think flight computers onboard a commercial airplane) so the chances of failure are as small as possible.

730,Ram Size Increment,Modern architecture is way more flexible. It is made to where it has driver programs which handle a lot of the storage for it. The processor itself also has microprocessors devoted just to moving things in and out of RAM while the central processor concentrates on the faster operations. 
731,Can someone let me know if my understanding of amortized run time in a dynamic array list is correct?,"The reason we use amortized analysis as in your case is when the operation is *costly* but only at certain (and less frequent) situations. 

The ""insertion"" operation*cost* into the dynamic array, when the current array size (x) is a power of 2 would be x+1. In other situations it would be merely just 1 operation, as we need to just insert an element at the end of the array (this array has space). 

Now according to the method, we need to find the average number of operations that is required for inserting ""x"" number of elements. 

The method is straight forward.

x th insertion     1  |   2   |   3    | 4 |  5   | 6 | 7 | 8 |  9   |               

Number              1 | 1+1 | 2+1 | 1 | 4+1| 1 | 1 | 1 | 8+1|
Of operations


So total number of operations for x insertions would be 1 + (1+1)+ (2+1) + 1 + (4 +1)+ 1 + 1+ 1+(8+1)+1... i.e. x + (2^0 + 2^1 +  2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 +...2^k)

Where k = floor (logx base2)

i.e. x + 2^(k+1) -1       ( sum of gp series)
i.e. x + 2*2^k -1
i.e. x + 2x -1
i.e. 3x -1
 
This is total number of operations needed for x insertions. For average number of instructions, it is (3x-1)/x ~ 3x/x = 3.

So on an average 3 instructions for insertion operation. According to big oh notation, it is just constant i.e. O(1).

The mistake you are doing is, you are applying big oh notation while calculating the number of operations itself, which is wrong. Big-oh notation is for the order of growth of functions. 

So calculate the average number of operations and see how many steps (operations) it requires. Those average number of steps will be in terms of your input x. This itself is your function. You can't just apply big-oh where and when as you like it. "

Not all algorithms are like that.

734,"Help, Python confusing me about data types","Python doesn't have fixed-sized, stack-allocated arrays. When you do `arr = [1,2,3]`, that is creating a heap-allocated list akin to a C++ Vector or Java ArrayList. Looking up how those two classes are implemented can give you a good understanding of what's going on. Internally, the list does store values in an array structure, but you don't get access to that. The del function is basically syntax sugar to call list.remove when the object passed in is a list index instead of a true delete or free in C/C++ since python is a garbage-collected language. "

738,What is the output of the pseudocode below if the variables declared in the main program are global?,"Let's examine this program line-by-line:

    Main
    Declare X as Integer, Y as Integer
        Set X = 1
        Set Y = 2

Two variables of type Integer, `X` and `Y`, are declared and initialized to 1 and 2, respectively.

    Call Sub(X, Y)

We call the function `Sub` with two arguments, specifically the `X` and `Y` we just declared and initialized.

    Subprogram Sub(Integer Num1, Integer Num2 as Reference)

We are now in the function call `Sub` with the two arguments. Now, in the definition of this function, we pass the first argument by value and the second argument as a reference. This means `Num1` in the function is a *copy* of the first argument, whereas `Num2` is a *reference* to the second argument. What this means is that whatever value is initialized to `Num2` will also change the value of `Y`, which we passed in. In contrast. any change to `Num1` will *not* have any affect on `X`, the first argument we passed in.

    Declare X as Integer
    Set Num1 = 3
    Set Num2 = 4

We declare a local variable `X` also of type Integer. We set `Num1` to 3 and `Num2` to 4. Remember that `Num2` is a *reference* to the argument passed in, `Y`. Thus, `Y` from the `Main` function is now initialized to 4. `Num1`, on the other hand, is just a copy of `X` from the `Main` function, so it can be thought of as a local variable.

        Set X = 5
        Write X
    End Subprogram

We set the local variable we declared earlier in the `Sub` function to 5 and write it to the console. We then exist the function and return to `Main`.

        Write X
        Write Y
    End Program

Remember that Y *now* has a value of 4, since we passed it in as a reference to `Sub` and initialized it to 4. Now, We initialized `X` earlier in the main function to be 5 so we write 1 to the console and since Y is now equal to 4, `Write Y` now prints 4 to the console. That is how the output is 5 and 14. Don't hesitate to ask any followup questions. I hope this helps! "
739,Where to start?,"Your first should most definitely be python, no doubt about it. It's very human readable, teaches you all the basic things that you'll need in every language, and is actually a pretty useful language to use if you don't want to do web dev or use go lower level. After you've learned python, figure out what you actually want to *do*, and learn a language/technology that enables you to do that. As I said, python might just be what you need. As to where to learn it, there are tons of websites, code academy, solo learn, YouTube, etc.

1. Work out how your game is going to work - in detail.

3. Figure out how your users are going to do stuff (turn-based, “real-time” - they’re basically the same but orders of magnitude harder to code)
4. Based on 1,2 &3 break it down into what the various actors and data structures are. (you’ll get this wrong, but as long as the basics are solid, you can iterate and correct)
4. Pick the language that’s most natural to you and start implementing. Don’t worry about the interface yet - get the mechanics working.
5-99. Iterate - especially if this is your first rodeo, the first few iterations will be awful, but you won’t realise until later. This stage can lead to initial AI implementations - and that may result in a premature entry to step 101

769,"New to computer science, can someone explain to me why this problem is computationally intensive?","Your algorithm seems correct, it is O(b); I don't see how this could be an exponential time algorithm at all.

In fact, there's an algorithm that can compute this in O(log b) time. From what I understand, you split b into its powers of two, and then compute the product of a raised to those powers, taking the mod whenever possible to avoid integer overflow.

For example, take a = 10 and b = 29. You can split 10^(29) into 10^((1\*1 + 0\*2 + 1\*4 + 1\*8 + 1\*16)) = 10^(1) \* 10^(4) \* 10^(8) \* 10^(16), and keep a running variable that keeps track of the current element to be multiplied, making sure to take the mod of it whenever it is updated. Since only log b elements are being multiplied together, this algorithm is O(log b).

794,"How do you make HTML and CSS code readable, reusable and efficient?","CSS code can be made readable with a CSS pre-processor like LESS, SASS, SCSS, post-CSS, or others. You can write readable plain CSS if you want though, just try to organize your rules in a way that makes sense to you and stick with it. CSS performance... Learn about what causes a web browser to reflow and repaint, and try not to do it. Also, try to have as few CSS rules as possible and don't make rules with long hierarchies. Re-usable? You might have a site-wide stylesheet and either smaller stylesheets for different pages OR specific names for elements with a unique theme. [css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com) has lots of good resources on this kind of thing ([https://css-tricks.com/efficiently-rendering-css/](https://css-tricks.com/efficiently-rendering-css/)). SO does MDN: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS). You should read the specs if you want to be a CSS expert [https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs.en.html](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs.en.html).

I think an important aspect of HTML reusability + readability is templating of some kind. That can be through a javascript framework, web components, a static site generator (like hugo), or something on the server-side of your app that can stitch together HTML files (rails, good ol' php). Efficient HTML? Lazy loading images could help with page load time, but that's more of a javascript thing. Slow HTML will likely come from interactions between CSS + HTML or JS + HTML. Try to keep the level of element nesting low. Prefetching is an HTML thing, you should look into that and add it to your document where appropriate. "
795,Study techniques for Computer Science/Software Engineering,"Computer science is like math or physics - you study theory but you also need to solve as many problems as possible (in compsci this involves writing code at some point, if necessary, but you can also just write solutions in pseudo-code to show that you understand how to do it).

Anki can help you a lot to study the theory. For example, you are taking a class in Operating systems - there is some theory involved, use flash cards or Anki to retain that information. The class will also have a practical component (hopefully), where you can solve problems and write code.

If you are a geek, you can set up Emacs to write the Anki cards in it and then ""upload"" them bulk to your running Anki instance. You can use ""snippets"" in Emacs to make writing the cards easier and almost automated. The advantage of this and associated org-mode is that you can mix latex, figures etc. into the cards.

If you are not used to solving problems and have never taken courses where you had to do so (and got tested doing so), you need to up your game and start doing it. Some sciences (like biology or geography) or humanities (like history, languages etc.) do not involve this approach and instead, rely on memorizing things and being tested on that or writing essays. If that's ALL you are used to, you may have issues going forward in your schooling. Cheers, hope this helps. "

819,Not feeling confident in my coding skills,"First off, you're likely suffering from what is commonly known as 'imposter syndrome', recognize that it's a pretty common thing, a feeling of inadequacy.  Understand you're not alone in feeling that way and I \*believe\* anyone who isn't a narcissist at some time feels this way.

Secondly, understand that this career, nor any career, is a good fit for everyone.  If you love this discipline than a betting man will bet on your success.  CS is hard....full-stop.  A good curriculum should be challenging because the industry is as well.  Only you can know if this is your path, but I feel that if you can look past the difficulty and still see enjoyment then it's simply a matter of 'sweat currency', work harder/smarter at it.

I've always loved CS and I often say I have no regrets, but that's a bit of an overstatement.  One evening after struggling endlessly on a particular course I found myself in my car on the edge of dropping out of school, driving south to find a completely different life.  After about 2 hours, \~120 miles I gathered my thoughts, cooled down, and returned to the library for 'round 99'.  Some people say that you measure the worth of something by the value of sacrifices you make for it.  Those long hours of study have given me a lifelong gift of a rewarding career and while I reflect on that 'one night about to give it all up' I'm glad I kept on struggling.  Things got easier for me, trust they will get easier for you if you're willing to put in the work and you love the discipline. "

821,Comp sci internships before College,"Good luck. It’s usually pretty hard for CS students to get internships even at smaller companies their first summer. Bigger companies tend to be a lot more competitive. It’d probably be better to see if any smaller firms are connected with your HS’s guidance office to see if there are any shadowing opportunities. 

Without an impressive GitHub portfolio it would be a hard gamble to find an internship. Aside from that just getting very comfortable with coding challenges on sites like hackerrank or leetcode. "

824,Cop to Coding,"I've been programming since I was \~10 years old in some form or another. I graduated with a bachelors in CS / math about 3 years ago. Been working in the industry since. Hopefully some of this is useful for you.

1. Practice leetcode or other algorithm / data structure challenges. These are the types of questions that many companies ask during interviews, maybe tying in an application of the type of work they do (e.g. Amazon might ask a question about programming a shipping algorithm).Additionally, build software! If you want to become a web developer, build a website that does something interesting. If you can't think of any ideas, just make a clone of a website that you use, or of something you find cool. You can put these projects on your resume and use them to job search with. Post them on github so employers can see them.
2. Experience is probably all that matters. If you show you can build a piece of software competently with your projects, employers will be attracted. Certifications don't hurt, though.
3. Calculus is used in some applications of computer science, but you likely won't see it in your day to day work unless you have a specialized job that requires it. Most schools require it for CS because it is useful to understand in some cases. Definitely not a requirement, and I know many successful developers who dropped out of high school having never taken any advanced math.
4. When you feel confident with it. Putting something on your resume is giving the interviewer permission to ask you about it. If you don't feel confident being asked questions about it, don't put it on your resume.
5. Web development is hot right now. If this is what you want to do (which I assume you do since you're asking about HTML), then I think you're headed in the right direction. I would add into the mix CSS (and more advanced SCSS), & javascript. After learning about these topics, you could move into learning about a popular web framework like React, Vue, or NextJS. These are a few of the technologies employers are looking for right now. If you're more interested in backend systems, servers, or anything that isn't web related, you might find C (or C++), Go, & Java more interesting.
6. Since you are a public safety officer, maybe you could try looking into some companies that are related. Having the experience you do, I think of companies like Axon that might be particularly interested in hiring you. They could appreciate insight from someone who's been in the shoes of the person using their product.
7. Don't be scared off by a job listing's ""required skills"". Most of the time you might not know 50%+ of what is on the list, but they still might be interested in hiring you. It is rare you will find a job listing and be able to check all the boxes. Apply anyways!
8. Consider taking an internship first. They won't expect you to know much, but it is a great way to get your foot in the door. Showing you are interested and passionate about technology in the interview can get you the opportunity.

Each player must outwit their opponent and make a path with their coloured tiles, either yellow or blue, to connect the two opposite sides of the 18-squared tile board.

To begin the blue player places one tile of their choice anywhere on the board. The yellow player then places a tile anywhere on the board and this continues until one player creates a pathway connecting their opposite sides of the board and is crowned the winner! players can start as many new paths as they want to, a new tile does not have to touch earlier tiles that have been placed. You cannot put a tile on top of your opponent’s tile but you can be clever and block their path. "

839,How does one jump right into coding?,"```""The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it."" -- Dennis Ritchie```

Find a tutorial on the basics. Then find a project and start smashing some keys.

If you have a specific goal (coding a game, or an OS), choose a language suitable for it and learn that.

If you want to learn coding and problem solving in general:  

Start by using Python to get a feel for coding. Its a great beginner language because

* Easy, readable syntax
* Built-in BigInt support
* Dynamic Memory Allocation
* Extensive Libraries 

Almost every function you are gonna use has been implemented, so you can focus on using them rather than trying to implement them.

After you feel comfortable coding, move on to a more restrictive language, like Java. BigInt and Dynamic Memory Allocation don't come by default, so you have to do some calculations beforehand in terms of memory usage (or just use the library functions).


By this point you will have enough experience to know what to do next. 

^(After that move onto C, and learn about pointers. C is even more restrictive than Java because it also doesn't have BigInt or Dynamic Memory Allocation, but on top of that, no Bounds Checking or Garbage Collection.)

846,Advice?,"Note: wall of text incoming, so skip to the TLDR if you want

What was it about CS that piqued your interest initially? You should go down that path, exploring new sub-fields of CS, until you find something you genuinely like. Forcing yourself through CS, or pretty much anything in life, is almost never the way to go. No amount of advice can instill artificial passion in someone, but I think your problem is not that CS isn't interested, but that that you haven't explored enough yet to find something worthy of interest.

I just graduated but I was also in your shoes as a first-gen student, and especially in a field like CS, I understand how daunting it initially seems to have no background, no head start, or any help to rely on from parents or relatives. I too chose CS half on a whim, and realized the skill disparity compared to my peers early on in college. However, you should use the clever people around you as a goal. Most of my freshman year I only studied CS for the sake of completing assignments or exams, and I sucked at nearly everything. But somewhere down the line, seeing how advanced my friends and classmates were motivated me to reach or exceed their level, and it comes as no surprise that a good friend group + environment is key. Clubs, hackathons, and advanced classes are good ways to go about obtaining both.

I got into competitive programming because one of my first uni friends was on the programming team and introduced me to it. I later got into computer vision research because one of my other friends was into machine learning (and while his specific field wasn't of much interest to me, it helped me eventually stumble across CV and other applications of ML, which I found I loved). To this day I continue to engage in both, inside and outside of school and work.

What's important to understand is that rarely will any school's curriculum walk you through everything, so much of what your classmates know (as you correctly realize) comes from what they've done on their own time. There's an abundance of resources and platforms (i.e. Coursera, Udacity, most interview prep sites, etc.) online at varying levels of expertise that cover various topics in CS, so you can go from knowing little to near-expert independently. It's okay to be behind (everyone starts somewhere), but there's no excuse for *staying* behind. 

That being said, if you aren't motivated by your classmates but still want to find something you love, many undergrad catalogs contain paths of study that are more specialized (cybersecurity, robotics, etc.) later in the curriculum (generally taken in the 3rd-4th year). Many of these coincidentally also take you from theory to something tangible, which is probably what you want. So dip your toes into all such paths, either on your own time or in your final year. If not motivated by personal interest, perhaps courses themselves will guide you to something you like. A lot of the process of finding things you like is based on luck and just putting yourself out there into unexplored territory. Who knows, CS might not even be what you actually want to do, but you won't know that until you've tried all of it.

As for the rest (like Github or LinkedIn), those usually just come along the way. Sure, you can showcase projects on Github, but first and foremost it (along with git) is a tool for collaboration and version control, and you should use it as such. Git can be learned from its own guide or a plethora of online resources, and you'll only get familiar with it by using it. Networking on LinkedIn is important and a huge benefit, which should be taken advantage of in college, and while it isn't necessarily the be all and end all of *landing* a job, it can surely help you *find* some.

**TL;DR**: put yourself out there by exploring things on campus or online, find like-minded people to bounce interests off of, and attend relevant events where you're outside of your comfort zone. Everything else will likely come along the way naturally.

There are so many data handoffs at this point that most of the encryption is done by default over the networks

If you’re talking about encrypting the data you’re transferring within your code, then you should look to the standard libraries encryption tools. You needed to be more specific about what technologies you are working with, and especially which part of the handoff you are trying to encrypt. If its something along the lines of a python/java web app, then you should be looking into the native encryption libraries.

That being said, Im not really sure what your post is getting at since you’re throwing around a lot of buzzwords. Most likely you’ll just do an initial handshake followed up by secured handoffs. You might want to head over to r/encryption to ask this question. Any which way you decide to implement it, there will most likely be a library you can use with standardized methods for encryption.

863,Multiple Producer Single Consumer circular buffer,"This appears to be a synchronization problem. You need to ensure that only one producer writes to the buffer at the same time. Therefore you need to ensure that the function that adds value to the buffer and moves current pointer to the next is atomic (meaning it always either finishes or doesn't start at all and is not interrupted).

My suggestion is to generate references and save them into buffer because copying value might create too much latency and causes a massive backlog.

So that's all about creating a buffer. Now to a single consumer. You're rightfully wondering whether singe consumer is going to be enough to keep the buffer from overflowing and I think we either do not have enough information or it is only possible to learn that by actually trying. So I wish you good luck at implementing your idea. "
864,I feel sick to my stomach,"I found thinking about what order you can build stuff in makes a big difference between being an average coder and being a good coder/engineer. Anyone can write code but an engineer will do it without introducing breaking changes.

This means focus on a way/process of introducing changes/features that doesn’t break things. If it’s a new feature you’re introducing so you can switch some existing functionality to make use of it, don’t start integrating straight away. Build the new feature in isolation whilst the old method remains in tact. When your new feature is ready (tests exist for the code and pass) you can then write a test that makes some assertion about how the new functionality should return results once integrated. It will fail. You can then update the code to make the test pass. At no point did the code break in between. Finally you can now remove any redundant/dead code to complete the job.

Most developers will just start hacking away at the new feature, updating the code in place, hitting road block after road block. Then because they’ve broken the system, they stress and stress that they’re doing a bad job, which isn’t necessarily the case. 

Very few developers I’ve worked with got it right early on, myself included.

If you can prioritise which bits of the system to change first so that you don’t introduce breaking changes, programming becomes a far more logical process rather than a headache. "

Business and engineering. In the business track, you will likely never use calculus professionally but it may be required in college. You will use accounting, statistics, potentially linear algebra. In an engineering career you may use all sorts of advanced math (calculus, differential equations, and beyond). You may get into circuit design, microprocessor design, DSP, firmware. So imagine what sort of work you see yourself doing. Guiding missiles, building bridges, image processing, robotics, factory control automation? Then an engineering track is for you. If instead, you imagine yourself writing banking or accounting software, business operations, etc. Look at a business track. You will use math for sure. So far you have not had a reason to apply what you know toward a solution. When you enter the work force you will be applying math to answer real questions and earn a living.

890,Graduting without internship?,"In Austin and the SF Bay Area, there are meetups that are basically job expos where you ""speed date"" with recruiters, mostly from startups but sometimes the larger companies show up as well.  HackerX is a company built around setting those up.  If you aren't in a major tech center (SF Bay Area, Seattle, LA, Austin), it might be more difficult to find one of these.  They are an excellent place to network if you don't have a network and I've always been impressed by something when I've gone to these just to check them out.  Be humble, be confident.  Have an idea of what kind of software you want to write, be it frontend, backend, or full stack, or maybe something completely different like devops or infrastructure, or maybe you want to focus on ML and data science.  They want all of that.

This will of course be difficult in the current hiring environment where companies have cut back on headcount, startups are struggling to find funding, etc.  You might want to consider looking at positions in state government IT departments as a hold-over if you can't get a foot in the door elsewhere.

Your background, believe it or not, actually makes you a more interesting candidate.  Focus on your leetcode problems, your algorithms and data structures, and I have no doubt you'll be able to ace the technical interviews.

To really come across as a winner, I would recommend looking up the leadership principles for large tech companies like FB, Apple, Amazon.  It's not enough to show technical brilliance in interviews at those companies; they want to see that you have a solid sense of direction and correctness of attitude towards the work that fits in with the company culture.  Expressing a growth mindset in the interview helps a lot and will take you very far.

My recommendation would be Amazon, specifically the AWS org.  They hire a lot of people directly out of college, at any age, and while it might not pay the best and you might have to relocate (although in this environment and with amazon's worldwide presence, it might not be to Seattle), it's a fantastic way to start your career even if you only stay for 2 years.

894,Seeking clarity about the role of API's and semantic interoperability,"Im not 100% clear on what you mean by ""semantic interoperability""

But there are several reasons for having services interact with each other through APIs.

One reason is that in general, you want loose coupling between systems so that you more easily can upgrade or replace that system if a need for that arises. "

899,What was your personal path to learning about computers?,"I wrecked my dads car.  He used the insurance money to buy a PC JR.  I used it to write a few Star Trek Games in BASIC and pascal.  When I joined the USAF I did well on the ASVAB and became a USAF flying IT guy for 10 years.  I logged 3,000 hours babysitting an IBM 4pi (360 variant) on E-3 Sentry air-frames.  Thats enough time to fly around the world at the equator 60 times or to fly from NYC to LA and back every day for a year.

After that I did 10 years at American Megatrends Inc developing BIOS.  From there I spent 10 years at Intel Corp doing similar work. "
900,How to continue learning after AP Computer Science A?,"I teach APCSA. If you are wanting more, what I would recommend is taking a Data Structure and algorithms course in Java. This is a common learning continuation. If you would rather go a different route, I would look at creating a game in Java like a simple snake .. then if you want to stretch it, create a server for a multiplayer game. This will keep you busy all summer. "

907,What do I need to learn to build this medium difficulty web project?,"I would suggest start simple. Make a website which just has text for now (like a blog). Even that will take a while if you are planning to build a custom CMS (content management system). Then add a way to embed YouTube videos (easier than hosting your own videos; you can always set uploaded videos as unlisted). Then add MCQ quiz feature with questions in image format and options to choose from. Keep the exercise building manual for now.

You will have to figure out authentication and authorisation as well for this. All this can be done via React/Vue and Node.js. You will have to use a content host too (S3, DigitalOcean spaces, etc)

All of this alone is going to take a lot of time but the good thing is that you can verify your product market fit while building this. Get continuous feedback from your users and build what they want rather than building something really complex and realising no one wants to use it.

Once you have a basic platform ready, you can then build cool features such as automatic exercise generation without getting overwhelmed. You may want to read this [paper](https://yangjiera.github.io/works/icwsm2018.pdf) on this. "
908,Mathematics for CS,"My discreet math course did use some summation notation and proofs that involved a very small amount of calculus. I would recommend taking Calc before discreet math just to make it a little easier if possible, but if you don’t it won’t kill you "
909,"As someone with a Bachelor's in Health Sciences, are there any online Master Degrees in Comp Sci that I can complete (ex. online) by bridging from the unrelated Bachelor's?","Look into UT Austin's Online MS program ([https://www.cs.utexas.edu/graduate-program/masters-program/online-option](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/graduate-program/masters-program/online-option)). While they do recommend having a computer science degree, if you can show that you have related experience that should be good.

>**A bachelor’s degree in computer science from a regionally accredited institution.** Other degrees may be considered (particularly in related fields such as electrical engineering, computer engineering or mathematics). Exceptions will be made on a case-by-case basis. Applicants who do not have a computer science or related degree should provide evidence of relevant content knowledge through coursework or work experience. Please detail relevant experience in your CV and personal statement. "
910,It is said that Computer Science degree is one of if not the very least stressful college majors? How is this true and what are your thoughts about it?,"I just finished my first year as a CS major and in my experience it wasn’t very stressful. The course load gets pretty heavy (at my university anyway) and can be intense, but as long as you put your head down and grind through it it’s not bad. It’s lot of work but you have tangible results. "
911,Business person wanting a MSCS,"In any MSCS program you will encounter nontrivial programming. If you do not even know how to program at this point, you are way out of your depth. My advice is to go to a community college and take programming 1,2 and 3. This will really help you decide if it is right for you, but keep in mind that even that may not be adequate preparation for an MSCS. "
912,Programming requirements for jobs.,"You don't cover all of them.

If you're a .net developer, you'd look for .net jobs. If you're a machine learning engineer, you'd go for mle jobs.

Obviously you're not stuck down one route, you can learn new skills and take on new technologies, but you can't expect to be qualified for every Software Developer job.

This is why less senior roles have fewer reqs. A graduate can come out with enough skills to get a junior job in most disciplines, and they can put a minor emphasis on a few disciplines with a side project or two. Over the years as you learn more about the field you're in, you develop a specialisation in that discipline. "

916,Having Doubts About My Computer Science Degree,"I went to acting school, got a BFA in drama. Now I'm getting my masters in CS.

Personally, I love CS because it makes sense to me. I got out of theatre because it doesn't make sense. Not talking about the classroom - there was always catharsis and profound meaning there. But out in the world that's a lot harder to find.

I have tons of friends who couldn't live without their theatre lives, and that's great. But there is a myth that in order to be a ""successful artist"" you have to kill yourself for your art - that's the only thing you can do. In fact, whether or not you like it, you will *have* to do something else to make a living. There just isn't money in art. ...You know, until you're famous. Spoiler alert: you won't be. You have to be ok with that.

So my suggestion: if you love your art, don't give it up. If you enjoy CS, let that be your survival job. If you hate CS, find something else to survive on.

Either love your work or allow your work to enable what you love. Both are valid paths in life. Just be realistic about the world waiting for you with an art degree.

(Sorry I can't help with your struggles in CS classes. But being in art school and surrounded by this do or die ethos was so toxic. Don't get sucked into the myths.) "
917,What should I have learned by this point in my CS career?,"Hey, another CS major here! I'll be starting my third year this fall, and like yourself, I have learned C++, Java, discrete math, linear algebra and finished calculus. I have had a few theory classes as electives, and some hardware and networking classes. My understanding is the Junior year is when shit gets real and you really start to learn some awesome stuff!

Don't be worried, you sound like you are on track. I'm sure others might be able to chime in with some recommended classes as well! Keep up the great work man! "
918,How to add another URL to an existing URL,"You should look deeply into dns.

DNS, Domain Name System is the protocol used to translate names of urls into IPs. This is necessary for computers to send IP packets to each other.

DNS has a hierarchy system with the root servers like com, net, org...

You can buy a domain name in those servers so that you can own yourdomain.com

A DNS request will respond with the corresponding DNS records which there are many types of, one of them is SOA or Start Of Authority. These records allow you to nominate another authority under your domain thus creating a multiple domain name.

Now you can setup locally yourself, or through third parties that offer the service, subdomains for example email.yourdomain.com

You haven't been very specific on for what puyrpuse you want to do this, but take into account that you need to be able to either control or buy from the authority above you. You can't have a domain that is mydomain.google.com as google would need to include you in the dns records.

You cannot do what you are asking and DNS is build to prevent your use case for security reasons. The only workaround would be to buy a domain very similar to the one above you, for example yourdomain.yütube.com "

928,Going to college to get a BS in Computer Science,bro I literally was in the same exact boat as you last fall. I decided that since I had been out of school for such a long time it'd be best to ease my way back into it. I can't tell you how glad I made that call. The best way that I can put it is that I'm in Calc I rolling steady with a 95 in the class. There was another guy I met in the class before covid who just started school as well and was in my calc class. This guy was clueless and it was somewhat irritating to help him out because if he'd gone back and take pre Calc he would've had a better understanding of the material. 
929,Data Science Bootcamp for those interested,"Be very weary of bootcamps.  Ask multiple people that have attended them how job searching has gone.  

I went to one almost two years ago.  I spent 3 months looking for a job before I was given a TA job for that very bootcamp.  (Most TAs there are bootcamp grads, which allows the company to inflate their job placement numbers after graduation.  Not only is this deceiving, but also the instruction comes from people that are still novices themselves.)

After spending six months ""teaching"", I got a job from a friend who got me hired as an installer.  Now I am a developer, but only because of ""who I know"".  I applied to over 250 jobs as a junior developer.  I only received 3 interviews, and only one went further.  I am the only one from the 30 people in my class and 30 people I ""taught"" that now has a developer job as of today.  (In Seattle, btw)

Bootcamps are really expensive, and what I have learned is that companies realize that graduates have no depth of understanding.  It's like going to ""bartending school"".  Bar managers will just throw your resume in the garbage, as dev managers do with bootcamp graduates. "
930,Current student advice,"Your grades will be taken into account to varying degrees depending on where you apply, but there are things you can do to stand out. The biggest one is personal projects.

Many companies won't care about an applicant with a 4.0 if they have an empty github or no prior experience. They like to see what you're passionate about and know you can apply what you've learned to real problems. I highly recommend that if you don't already have personal projects, start one in a field that interests you. Employers will ask about these projects in an interview, so it's important it's something you can talk intelligently about. "
931,FinTech and Cybersecurity thesis,I can help. PM me. 
932,How not to forget?,"I wouldn’t stress too much about that. Retaining information requires constant exposure to that information. There’s a reason you don’t remember the things you learned in high school, just like your parents, and that’s because you aren’t using the information frequently enough. You have to tell your brain that this piece of info is important, and you want it to stick. That usually comes most naturally with routine exposure. 

For CS, routine exposure is easy. Just code something—anything!

You’re right though; it is a lot of information to take in, especially when moving at a fast pace. This is where you learn to prioritize the key concepts: you can always google how to declare an array in java in an instant, but it’s a lot harder to reteach yourself what an array is. 

Hopefully this isn’t too over-simplified, and I imagine you’ll find a more detailed answer from someone with more practical job experience, but this is how I still remember learning my first language four years ago freshman year :D

My philosophy has gotten me this far: if you want to retain it, use it! "

950,Advice for Masters/Grad School,
951,What do I need to learn computer science,"What appeals to you about being an 'IT Manager' over say other roles in IT?

When picking out a profession it is important to have an interest for the topic itself, regardless of whether you are managing people or not. If IT is something you're interested in, start learning and building stuff now. You don't need a company to do IT. 

IT Manager is not a professional field in itself, it is a job that more experienced IT professionals who happen to have a desire to coordinate other professionals tend to take on.

In IT you typically have two directions to go after being in an entry level role for a few years. You can double-down on technical expertise and become a 'tech lead'/'subject matter expert'/'senior engineer' or go down the management route.

If the people-skills aspect of being a manager is what appeals to you, consider exploring professions that allow you to lean into that passion, like HR, training, or social work.

If you you are interested in getting started with IT, a computer will be important. Contrary to what other people might say, at your age I do not think you should focus on a checklist of things you should learn. Learning that way will get boring and tire you out. What you need to do is get excited. Think about something you want to build: a website, a game, a blog. Start googling (e.g. how to make a simple website). Soon enough you will branch out organically into the different parts of IT. At this stage in your education, having fun and getting obsessed with trying to make an idea come to life is more powerful that any textbook. If you bump into a problem that needs math to solve, you can learn the math then (ask your math teacher to help you!). Learning math with the hope that it will somewhere down the line help with IT (but not know exactly how it will help) is a very demotivating way to learn. "

961,are there jobs in cs that involve creativity?,"I think a lot of the time the end goal is a creative project but the building blocks of making the end goal are just that.

For example the creators of sonic pi, a platform that allows people to play a computer as if it is an instrument spent years building out a language and framework to make this possible.

To make sonic pi run as good as it can it takes a lot of grit, however, thousands of lines of optimizations builds something beautiful — a platform that connects people, music, and computers .

I think the flexibility in CS is that because so much of the world is being changed by computers you can go and change it yourself after working in industry and optimizing other peoples projects and visions.

You should def consider majoring in it. "

968,How the hell do I do a moveToBack/moveToFront function on a queue?,"I think you're not supposed to just pick out the number in the middle of the queue and put it on front. Doing so invalidates the purpose of the queue. What you need to do is to keep on dequeueing number from front and put them to back until the desired number you want is on the front of the queue.

Say you have 1 2 3 4 5 and want to put 4 on front...
First iteration: 2 3 4 5 1
Second iteration: 3 4 5 1 2
Third iteration: 4 5 1 2 3
Then we stop. We now have 4 on front. "

970,How to Learn Scripting,"A good way to start would be watching tutorials on YouTube for simple projects and follow along. There is a site called HackerRank that usually is a good way to learn various languages/concepts. Pick a couple of projects you’d like to try, and learn as you go. Python is a good language to start with if you don’t already have a language of choice.


Here’s just a simple project idea: Write a Python script to tell you how many days until your birthday. Expand it to include the birthdays of your family/friends. If within two weeks of one of their birthdays - have it tell you to get them a card/wish them happy birthday on <date of their birth>.

Usually playing around with some simple projects is the best way to pick up on the concepts. Just dig in and enjoy the process. "
971,Any good (free) resources where i can learn .NET these days?,[Microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn). 
972,How is programming in test automation different from programming in software development?,"Test automation is a lot of learning the specifics of company-specific architecture and internal APIs because that’s what you’ll be using (and testing) every day. You’ll also need to know to code (obviously) as well as all the details of a test framework and it would also be helpful to know something like Jenkins. Now, the difference is data structures & algorithms aren’t as important in your job. At this point you’re basically validating that answers are correct so the high-performance algorithms are already taken care of by the backend engineers. So if you’re more interested in developing new features for the end users or applying your knowledge of DS&A you’ll probably be bored in test automation. That being said, not everybody cares about those so for some people it’s a good fit "
973,Math books related to CS,Discrete mathematics by Noman L.

975,Confused CS major,"For me, computer science was, in general, the study of computers and how they work. While programming was a key aspect, the focus during my academic years was not only the history of computing, and the many different architectures of computing devices, but also computational / mathematical theory. The science part covered implementation and experimentation for transforming those theories into physical existence. (Note that this last part doesn't necessarily require electronics. Indeed, refer to the classic Babbage machine era.)

For me, CS has always been the study of how computers work than how to program them. When I graduated, I was hoping to get into the field of designing and build *new* computer technologies. However, in my 30+ year career, I've typically held jobs nominally titled *Software Engineer*. <sigh> "

Not that you're likely to ever need to build your own language, the stuff you learn will help provide a good base for algorithms, design, optimizing and stuff.

Like others have said, choose the interesting stuff, not the useful stuff. The programming skills for one course are relevant to the others. "

It's too different from smoke wind tunnel videos to appear accurate, so I think it is inaccurate and ""fun"" rather than science. I figure that an industry study (professionals) would use a wind tunnel and smoke for precise, reliable videos of the airflow.

[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4103/p531.jpg](https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4103/p531.jpg)

Air is too elastic to flow in that fashion, the high pressure areas mix into the low and diffuse and even out, whereas in a liquid the lack of compression-diffusion elasticity causes the turbulance to stay constant as it does in this video.

Perhaps it was developed on top of a fluid library and it lacks the graphics to illustrate elasticity of air.

There wasn't a problem that was solved - just added complexity to something rudimentary. There wasn't anything abstract or novel in the execution or outcome that isn't more easily addressed through other means. And wow... the execution was lacking. The electrical components were simply assembled from off-the-shelf items, the mechanical components are rudimentary and sloppily made, and they have to hand-tailor the instructions for each song - so nothing apparently abstract or elegant in the software side of things either it seems. If it's a simple hand-off between the computer and system controller, then at least it's somewhat cool.

After all of that, the glockenspiel sounds horrible what with mallets bouncing and resting on the bars, and being drowned out by the solenoids.

Significant privacy concerns aside.... machine vision is neat, and I appreciate their understanding of that fact.

Honestly guys, a wind turbine fixed on the ground can extract energy from the wind, why do you think that it would be different on the car? Of course you would need a wind speed with a component opposed to the car direction to be able to extract more energy than needed to move the turbine. In that case it's exactly the same principle as a normal turbine, the energy extracted is superior to the energy necessary to keep it at the car speed.

However, if you tell them ""I have a job offer elsewhere. If I'm still in the running, and you're interested, please give me an offer."" Then they will finally adult up and tell you that they won't be making an offer because they don't feel bad about saying no since you have an offer elsewhere.

1436,"Stanford researchers have a 100% clean energy plan that would balance 2,000 GW of solar capacity and 2,300 GW of wind power with 3,300 GW of battery capacity and a large amount of flexible load","[This is a very good talk on the subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LAuDTNW5dw&t=1465s) that shows calculated overcapacity factors for various amounts of energy storage given different mixes of solar and wind as primary renewables. TL;DW: 50% solar and 50% wind, you can be just about 100% renewable with overcapacity of 120% and 12 hours of battery storage. You still have the issue of localization and extended outages (no solar for longer periods in winter, and there could be times of low wind that overlap). I think this could be solved in most places with on-site battery backups (especially for homes) that would provide 48 hours of local backup in addition to grid-level storage. On average, this would require 60kwh of storage per home for 48 hours of complete off-grid backup. With battery prices falling below $100/kwh soon, at scale, this might cost $8000 per home, or $27 per month amortized over a 25 year term. These local batteries could either be owned by the homeowner, or rented from and managed by utilities. "

Just last semester I achieved my first scholarship and brought my GPA back up to a 2.8 and was back in good standing with the school from years ago when I dropped out.

I feel a little cheated, because I was under the impression that this was an Engineering degree.  Only after I paid for these classes and made a resume including ""Engineering"" as my degree, was I corrected that this was an ""Engineering Technology"" degree.  I feel like I'm out a few thousand dollars and I'm not completely sure if this will be the right decision for me!  I have absolutely no problem with the math or science of an engineering degree.  That's why I decided to switch to engineering!

But they referred me to a school for an ABET accredited ET BS in Florida, and I think that would qualify me for the PE license?

So do I rip the bandaid now and switch back to an Engineering AA??  I don't even know if I'll be able to afford an ABET accredited BA without obtaining a job in the field with some kind of tuition reimbursement, and that will put me another semester behind!   "

It was a fantastic experience when it wasn't rush hour. Summer during rush hour... well... less so.

Regardless, tickets run about $2.50 each for a ride. 
With nearly 1.7 billion rides per year and a budget for the MTA of about $17 billion. 

It seems to be a $10 subway ride isn't the end of the world, considering how expensive a cup of coffee is in that town.

Also, the other issue I had, it seems that if I took the train, it didn't matter if it was just a couple stations or all the way up to Harlem from the Financial District, I paid the same price unless I changed lines.
That doesn't make sense from the cost to the system my ridership incurs: weight, volume on the train at rush hour, etc. 

It seems that a short ride should be more affordable than a long one, as an example. Prepay a full-price fair, but if you exit early, then you get some back into your account. Either than, or try a toll road system of payment where you pay as you go down the system through RFID on a card or something.

Even if the center can counteract for any minute disruption it can only send the ball out of the center.  My point was, by translating the surface during the impact, spin could be induced.  This effectively dampens translation forces, creating a “pull” towards the center.   The spin can then be negated on the next bounce by translating the surface opposite.

It’s only an idea, the feed back loop sounds horrendous at this point and given the sensors may be secondary to the delay.  How do you infer spin?  "

The real problem is that...the underclass struggles with the sense of ""fairness"" as it pertains to ""effort as an effect on result"". They want an equal result, with a less than equal effort.

Sacrifice and ""above average effort"" is a cruel mistress as it pertains to results. Is it ""fair""?...life is NOT fair. It never has been, and as far as I see it, it never will be. Embracing a doctrine of fairness is a losing battle. Embrace fairness if you want, I would rather be successful. "

Geared turbofan is not a new idea, it's obvious that if you make an ""ideal turbine"", it's rotation speed will never match the ""ideal fan"" speed. A gearbox fixes that but such a high power high speed gearbox was not economically viable before. 

Most of that 30 years it was not ""in development"" as much as on the back burner.

For example indices are often black, brown, or grey throughout a sum like this even if they contain terms that would normally be a different color. "
1706,"Not an apple hater, but damn.","OP, you’re seriously letting this guy pull the wool over your eyes and it’s sad. His first point concerning luxury is completely off base. Luxury does not necessarily mean durable. It mean high quality. High quality items can still break because they’re a lot more complex. It’s the same reason Toyota’s last a lot longer than expensive luxury cars. If you want to go buy a Nokia brick phone I’m sure it’ll last you for as long as you live if thats what you’re after.

Also, his point saying how as a repair person he sees a lot of Apple products is obviously going to be true considering Apple products are overwhelmingly owned by consumers. There’s way more Apple products being used than other brands and that means there’s more chances for a person who needs a repair to have an Apple product. 

Many of the “problems” he brought up weren’t even really true problems. I’m sure a select few encountered the iPhone 6 bend/flex problem, but everyone in my family and a lot of my friends have owned an iPhone 6 and not one of them have ever showed any signs of bending. 

He also likes to bring up the fact that people were unable to turn on their laptops because of a problem that could only be fixed under warranty if they turned on their laptops - which happened to be a very very old laptop, but he conveniently forgets to mention that Apple fixed iPhone batteries that had problems or MacBook keyboards for very little to no charge at all which I found out first hand was a very easy and simple solution. Not once did I feel like Apple was screwing me unless it was due to something I caused like dropping and cracking my screen. Again luxury doesn’t mean it’s built like a tank. 

Finally, as an engineer which I assume you’re not, you can’t expect to have a 100% success rate with everything especially when it’s on the cutting edge of technology. You seem shocked to hear this as if every single brand out there doesn’t have these problems and has an equal or better product. You might not be an Apple hater but the guy in the video definitely is and he’s selectively picking and choosing things and twisting them to trick gullible people into believing the nonsense he’s saying.

1731,The Material Science of Metal 3D Printing,"I have a few things to add on to this video, which were touched on briefly, but not necessarily in the scope of the video. 3D printing \*is\* a new process and we're learning more about it, but for some parts, it is definitely a cost benefit.

Consider both RelativitySpace and SpaceX -- both of these companies currently 3D print their rocket chambers. These get very hot during operation, and you could definitely destroy the chamber within seconds if you don't have a way to cool them. Conventionally, the process is that you have to mill the cooling channels. The larger the chamber, the more channels you have to mill. Sometimes these channels can have bifurcations which can even further increase machining time. Then, you have to close out the channels somehow. 

1, you can try electronickel plating, a process that takes a long time (and requires a large bath). 

2, you can try laser cladding (a process similar to DMLS - requires a machine). 

3, you can try to ""shrink fit"" a jacket onto the chamber - but if your tolerances aren't exactly right, the jacket will not properly bond to half of the channels.

Something that was touched on in the video was the cost and number of machines required to make 3D printing sustainable, and used the chambers as an example -- then proceeded to use injection molding as a counterexample for kicking out parts quickly. Try to MIM a bunch of finished chambers at one time -- go ahead, I'll wait. 

The fact is, making these chambers with conventional manufacturing techniques also takes a long time, and also requires multiple machines (for each process step) if you want to increase part output. For these chambers, if speed is of the most importance (think about it -- delaying launch dates ALSO costs money), I think 3D printing is the way to go. Hell, for a lot of smaller parts, 3D printing could save a lot of money. 

Of course, you wouldn't send your model of a conventionally machined part and ask the vendor to print it. The part should be designed for 3D printing (and hopefully, with the idea of no machining to light machining afterwards -- otherwise you haven't done the process its justice). As you would design a part for conventional manufacturing, you would design it for 3D printing -- perhaps you could include a non-solid ""in-fill"" to reduce part weight while still retaining overall strength. You wouldn't design a part to have an ""overhang"", where it has to build solid material on top of loose powder; and if you did, proper support structure would be put in place so that it could be built effectively. To maximize output, you could include multiple parts on the same build plate (and they don't even have to be the same part) -- the video showed a few frames of impellers being stacked on a build plate, but didn't really talk about this point.  

Also, The stress relief process is so extremely important in all 3D printed parts. When you print, you have to attach the part to something (a build plate) and in the process of fusing the layers together you create so many internal stresses. The video talked about trying to remove internal stresses with different scan structures (5 mm squares are pretty big, if you think about the fact that the powder grains are 40µm big in diameter), but the most important part is the annealing. Obviously, you have to separate the part from the build plate at some point, but if you try to bandsaw or EDM the part off, parts (especially larger parts) are more likely to ""potato chip"" or warp. "
1732,this gear box,"That's certainly a cleaner design than Sturmey-Archer's planetary systems with a lot more gears.

Since a chain driven bicycle can be extremely efficient at power delivery to the rear axel, I have to wonder if this little box improves on that feature.

Some riders and powered systems may test the E-45's ability to withstand high torque loads, but you'll probably manage that with design and material improvements.

With proper care a tree can soak up 100 gallons a day for a high estimate.  Anyone who ever had to work an energy conservation problem can probably imagine the amount of work that much water would do on these pillars.

Another method might to build a canal or similar structure to control flow under the bridge.  Make sure it never again hits the flat side of the pillar to push it over.

As for the finishing on the beater and dough hook, mine look cosmetically identical, not sure if white finish is paint or powder coat, but it's been durable -- my mixer has seen heavy use for 35 years (full bowl bread/pasta dough ~5#/wk). I often run it continuously for an hour -- 4 consecutive batches with only brief pauses. This is their entry level machine, still winning Cooks Illustrated stand mixer bake off.

We should point out the important work female and male engineers have done, but I wouldn't hold my breath that someday 50% of engineers will be women. Just like I don't expect that someday 50% of early childhood teachers will be men. We shouldn't stop anyone from pursuing whatever they want. But we shouldn't expect equality of results.

From the antivirals used for HIV to the malaria drug to increase Zink adoption in the cell none of those has had a proper study, but not giving them is considered unethical. In the same light not having someone hoocked up to a noise machine made by an engineer but not FDA approved, should be in the same category. "

1948,Volvo Trucks - Emergency braking at its best!,"I do not understand why it must threshold brake.  That implies that it may partially be relying on the surface traction to be consistent and of a friction level within whatever tolerance range it assumes dry pavement to be.  It does not seem to gradually bleed off speed nor accommodate any significant difference in tire grip.  What happens in rain, on a gravel or sandy surface, in snow, on ice, etc?  I assume it just rear ends everything every time in any situation that isn't ideal.

With the modern and quite functional adaptive cruise control, I would VERY much expect the system to blend to the traffic speed and maintain a moderate driving distance, especially due to the very high differences in braking distance between cars and semis.

As much as this is supposed to tout the tech, which is interesting, I can only think of all the ways it could fail horribly just because it doesn't operate defensively and with high margins which is the ONLY way a semi should drive if autonomous in any way.  Its capabilities are just so vastly lower than all the vehicles around it. "

1976,Taipei 101 tuned mass damper in action during earthquakes in Sichuan,"What you are talking about is a very classical engineering debate.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XggxeuFDaDU

The damper is always in motion and I know that first hand.  I have also been to the top and that is in motion a lot more than I would have liked it to be after a week of eating sushi.

The damper acts like a capacitor in a circuit.  Your rigid parts are more like the resistors.  But they built the building as an engineering marvel.  While they were building that every plastic toy in the US had 'Made in Taiwan' stamped on it's bottom.    

So that damper swings forever like a pendulum.  And unlike the very rigid twin towers in New York and surrounding buildings Taipei 101 was built to flex and move with it's surroundings.  There are frequent wind storms and earthquakes.  

And building a building like that where it was.  It put it self in the way of strong winds.  From an engineering perspective it was a nightmare.  But it just so happened that everyone who lived on that street was an engineer.  

TL:DR  The ball always moves and it was designed to. "

1991,Is it possible to be over qualified for a internship,I respect the grind but people do care about more than just resumes.

However, if you did have an interview for position A and they had a good recruitment team/process in place, they would most likely pull up your old interview notes to see why you weren't selected for that position. Whatever they recorded for the previous interview will heavily impact if you get an interview for position B. "
1998,Feedback questions after rejection when you work alongside the interviewers,"You can put your best foot forward and still not get the job because someone else did just that tiny bit better. Sometimes it's just not meant to be and you have to come to terms with that. Honestly, it's better to come away thinking that it's a missed opportunity that you tried your best on and it was out of your hands than because you didn't try hard enough and you know you could have.

Mind you, what you're feeling is of course completely normal in this situation, and it's always going to be awkward if you're applying for a role where you work with the interviewers if it doesn't work out.

In terms of feedback, think of a few key moments in the interview you might want to get feedback on. Were there any particular questions you struggled with? What did the interviewers think of your responses to certain questions. Did you miss any opportunities to talk about X, for example? What did you answer well? Make a note of which responses were a hit or a miss. A lot of interview questions are the same so you'll probably end up answering a lot of the same stuff in your next interview.

I think it's also fair for you to ask what it was that put the other person ahead of you. Sometimes there's a legit reason, like maybe they have a bit more experience so would be easier to train, for example. It will be interesting to see what they say here. "

2002,[UK] Question about GCSEs/Work Gaps and your CV,"I don’t have much experience in this but if you don’t get any feedback in a couple of hours or so, try posting with a different title.

I think your question applies to any location as well as any educational qualifications. 

For example if someone is scrolling through and they see “UK” , “GCSEs” & CV all in the same title, it’s gonna limit replies as this is so niche but yet someone from anywhere let’s say US or Australia might have been in a similar situation, having the experience but poor high school grades as well as a recent gap in their resume. "
2003,Got rejected from the only job i was qualified for,[removed] 
2004,Has anyone else been rejected by the Google hiring committee without any feedback?,"1. Yes it's very good that you made it all the way to the hiring committee.
2. It's hard to say if you were or not. Google has a very proprietary hiring system where you are scored on a variety of criteria. You did well enough score-wise to move you forward to HC.  


That being said, Google does do better than most with respect to giving feedback to candidates. I don't think that you necessarily need it; there were probably other factors going on which got them to reject you at this stage. From what I was told by a friend who is a recruiter at Google, it's very rare that you get rejected at that stage - but it is known to happen - probably because they couldn't truly find a spot for you in any group at the company.

My suggestion to you is to simply thank the recruiter for her time and see if you can apply again in 6 - 12 months. Maybe by then you will be able to get through HC.

Sorry. "

2017,Feeling very discouraged after first job interview rejection?,"I've had similar feedback that sounded like it was meant for a different person.

2025,How do you find the motivation to keep applying?,"I'm in the same boat - sort of. I graduated last August, I just turned 21 this month. When I first started applying for jobs, for every 3 applications, I was getting at least one interview. I didn't even apply to many jobs. Maybe 20, got 6 offers. Dazzled everyone by being a 20 yr old graduate - my grades were shit but most employers seemed to be easily impressed. One or two from my town knew who I was since I was my hs' val and young at the time. So that halo carried over. Ended up taking a job at the same company my mother worked, great paying corporate position. Got fired in a week (Oct '19). I hated my former boss for (what I felt at the time) ruining my life over an assumption. I have almost no job experience and a useless degree in English. I got a seasonal job for two months but in my parents' opinion, I've been unemployed for five months now.

I just keep applying. I apply to a minimum of 10 - 15 jobs a day since the day I lost that job. I don't get a single phone call or interview (aside from during the holiday season) but I keep trying. I've been rejected from retail, grocery stores, convenience stores, fast food, warehouses, admin/offices, several cities, school boards, states, and the feds. Businesses small and large. Countless internships. I have no friends, hobbies, or talents. But I don't stop. My only blessing is that I have zero responsibilities or bills. My day consists of applying for jobs, reading, and studying (I'm enrolled in a post bacc program through my uni online). 

I have no motivation for anything but getting a decent job. There is nothing special that pushes me forward. I just want to achieve the bare minimum an adult should achieve. I keep applying because unless I win the lottery or my parents drop dead tomorrow, I'm not gonna be a millionaire and not have to work. "
2026,Failed a job interview and feel down,"Rejection always sucks, but don’t give up. Rejection is only dangerous if it stops you from going after what you want in life. I made this [video](https://youtu.be/xv-gW7WuOzI) on strategies for coping with rejection. There are some journal prompts to work through to move away from blaming yourself to instead focus on what you learned from this experience. 

Also you can train yourself to get comfortable speaking and interviews, the same way you study for anything. You can find great YouTube videos on interview prep, do mock interviews with friends, look into public speaking communities like toastmasters, try an improv class. It’s not impossible, it’s just a muscle you need to develop. "
2027,"Accepted offer letter and got hired, but just received email they’re looking for other candidates?",Did they tell you the job offer was rescinded? Are there multiple people in this role at one time? 
2028,Can't get over being rejected for job?,"I know your pain, I'm in the exact same situation. Made it through three rounds of interviews, burned a lot of PTO, for sure I thought I had the job. All my friends and family were proud. Then I get an email saying they selected another candidate.

It's been hard, like really hard. I feel that my acute depression is becoming chronic, but I sat down yesterday and applied to 11 new jobs and started feeling sorta better. I wish you the very best in your endeavors. I'm stuck in the same old job, but I keep praying that something new will come.

This has been a hard lesson for me to learn, but I now understand to never expect anything out of third round interviews. I was so confident, but when I face this situation again, I'll be better prepared. "
2029,Hurts Not Getting Chosen,"It does sting. After a dozen like that, you'll get used to it.
One thing that helps me a bit is to notice that often NOBODY got hired. The job opening was pulled. Or I've been told they went with another candidate only to see the job opening relisted in a week or two, so either they made a bad choice or they just plain lied to me. "

2031,Can I reach out about a rejection email?,If you have nothing to lose than why not? Job hunting in the age of corona is a process with less formalities 
2032,How do you keep from getting broken down by the job hunting process?,"You really have to go into every application and interview with a good attitude, but LOW expectations. 

You have to remind yourself constantly that no matter how good your interview(s) go, these employers are overwhelmed with options and, quite honestly, most of them aren't very good at this. They don't really know how to pick/find/recognize talent when they see it. Instead, they are looking for reasons to NOT hire you. It's stupid, but it's true. 

It's a grind and it's very difficult to keep yourself ""up."" Remember, expectations low......and honestly, it's probably not a bad idea to play things as Vanilla as possible in order to NOT give them a reason to discard you. Sounds stupid, but I truly believe this.

You have to remember that before you walked in the door, they already have an idea in their head of what they want, no matter how unrealistic it is. You have to try and keep yourself neutral in their eyes. "
2033,Is it worth it to contact HR admin if I believe resumes are not being reviewed properly?,"In my experience, government jobs often get posted out of requirement when they want to promote from within since they still have to post it. The applications are long and confusing, making it easy on the other end for them to throw a bunch out over trivial stuff.

 I wouldn't raise a stink personally, but that's my $0.02.

2036,Had 1st interview today and was told by senior recruiter she would schedule me for the 2nd round but just received automated rejection in email?,"This happens a lot. The recruiter has a phone screen and then sends your information to the hiring manager who for unknown reasons decides they don't want to bring you in for an interview.

We were very clear in our rejection letters that it was not a stepping stone position.   We wanted an ""admin for life"" ;o)

2045,Seven internal interviews and am burnt out.,"Why did they reject you? Did they give you any feedback? What helps in a large organization is to know somebody in the position you’re aiming for, especially if they can recommend you. Have you had a chat with some of the senior analysts to see how their skill set and experience differs from yours? I’m my company it is unlikely that you will get another other role just by following the standard application process, rather they expect that you’ve had various informal coffees with people in or related to the role.

The longer version is that it depends on the situation. Why did I get rejected in the first place? Was it something that wasn’t too personal or was I missing a skill.. have I improved since then?

Funny enough, there’s this job I’ve been literally staring down for months to pop back up and it finally did after like 8 months (crazy, right?). The first time I reached out to the recruiter but it got me nowhere. Now it’s up again and I’ve apples. Changed up my resume and really tried to showcase why I am beyond a perfect fit. 

I’m hoping for the best. 

Also, I’ve gotten a job once that I applied twice to - my last job that is. I applied in early December and kinda felt like they didn’t look at it and then I saw the position pop up again over the holidays and I tried it out. "
2050,Getting rejected....but why,"They either don't find you to be the best candidate in terms of qualifications or they just don't find they like you as a person. There are two factors at play when getting a job during an interview: your resume gets you the interview, your personality gets you the job. There are a lot of factors on the sub conscious level which determine who gets the job. Attractive people stand abetter chance of landing the job offer than actual qualified folks. Whether you have a lot in common as the interviewer, such as personality and tastes in life style and characteristic traits play a big role. "

2057,Getting Accounting Gigs,"Language is going to be an issue, but it’s not what’s holding her back now if she hasn’t gotten interviews yet. 

Her application materials should state explicitly that she’s authorized to work in the country and will not require sponsorship. 

There are studies that show that having a non-Western name on applications can be detrimental, so I might recommend using a nickname if possible (e.g. Tricia instead of Trang, for example).

One guy has actually called me 4 or 5 times over the years. It just never coincided with a time I was looking. There’s a much better chance of this happening at a mom and pop operation though. "
2060,Running in circles due to lack of work experience,"I’m a recent grad going through this problem of not being able to land even an entry level job due to lack of experience. It’s rough but since I’ve only been at it for a few month I’m just going to keep applying till someone gives me a chance. 

If I had been applying for years and still not found anything then I might give up and either get a job in a different field or go back to school for something else. 

I’m not telling people to give up on their dreams but after awhile if money is getting tight you might have to take a job you’re not interested in to support yourself. "
2061,"How do I react on ""wrong"" feedback in a job rejection?","Never argue with negative feedback after an interview.  Nothing good can ever come of it. If you don’t agree, then just forget about it and move on. 

They will never reconsider their decision based on what you say, so there is no point in going there.  

Besides, I know many managers that started out by trying to be helpful and provide feedback, but they usually stop after awhile because they get tired of people trying to argue with them. 

Don’t be that person. "

2064,I was almost hired by a government agency. I didn't pass the suitablility but they may still be interested?,"I would think he's simply had other things going on and got behind on his email. I work for government and unfortunately, I end up doing this sometimes. I'm only allowed to work 40 hours a week, I'm often away from my computer and not in a good place to write a meaningful email on my smartphone. Every two or three weeks, I have a block of time when I sit down and listen to all my old voicemails that built up and answer all the old emails that weren't about an imminent issue. (Someone they cannot hire to meet their immediate staffing need is not an ""imminent"" issue for them to deal with their current workload, like responding to you was when you were in the running. Perhaps he was just waiting until he could take the time/care to write something thoughtful.)

I wouldn't take it too personally - some people may be uptight about your history but many others will empathize.  I would NEVER bother to say I'd keep someone in mind for the future if I didn't truly mean that. Instead I'd stick to saying I was sorry about what happened, acknowledge all the work/effort the person made and the inconvenience, and say goodbye with a thank you. "

2071,Is it just me or is it unusually difficult to get a job?,"The job market challenges are because of ""trickle out"" economics...In the past I was a big believer in trickle down economics and believed it worked. I still believe in trickle down economics but thats not what we have in this country anymore. We have trickle out economics. The jobs that were previously created trickled down and create opportunities in America. The jobs that are created today trickle out to low cost employment in third world countries. Almost all of the positions we used to source to entry level Americans are now going to mid-level employees in third world countries that pay half what an entry level American makes.

&#x200B;

From a business perspective you can get a person with years of experience for less than you can get an entry level candidate in the Americas. There are many financial, social, etc, etc problems that this process is creating. Business should be wiser and stop the practice because it will have lasting effects for them. They havent figured out this process is gutting internal expertise for future generations.. "

2073,Rejected for a job due to personality test results?,"My company uses those tests, and it's a pile of bogus. Some old man sifts through the answers and gives his ""professional opinion"" of how this candidate will behave based on their answers to the questions. I don't think theres even an algorithm, I'm pretty sure it's just how he feels about a person's answers.

But like... This dude isn't part of a company nor is he particularly qualified to give this kind of advice, he's just some random old dude that I guess gave a good sales pitch back in the day. My company president/CEO/HR person takes his word as gospel. It's absolutely bizarre. "

2077,Asked for an interview only to get a rejection letter?,"They probably hired someone else.

I had a similar situation. I was scheduled for a phone interview and the day before was given a ""rejection"" email. They were transparent and told me they hired another candidate due to timing pressure. "
2078,"I added my photo my cover letter, did I mess up?",There’s a good chance your resume was thrown out because of this. Keep your photo off your resume. But you only applied for one job so no worries. 
2079,Not being kept after seasonal,only 2 out of 26 were hired for FT roles. it's possible that they had slightly better sales or maybe a little more experience  then you not because management thought you have a problem getting along with people. if possible ask your supervisor if he or she can provide any feedback on your performance both negative and positive but if not it sounds as if you're on the right track although you should find out why some people don't like you and if you can do anything differently to change that for other roles. 
2080,Email to a recruiter,"Off the top of my head...

>*Hello so-and-so,*

As I am sure you can imagine the job hunt process is a bit of a grind and can be discouraging at times, but I thought my time at ABC company was very refreshing.

2083,How do you keep going,"Only thing that gets me through the week is the fact that I have D&D to look forward to on the weekends. I've largely just given up, and have accepted that things will not get better but without the guts to actually off myself I'm just sorta just waiting I guess. I know it isn't a healthy mindset, but it is the one I've sort of settled in to. "

2088,Turned down because of too high salary expectation. No discussion to be had at all. Is this normal?,"I always hate the awkward take about pay to potential employers. Especially when they want you to tell them, this is a means for them to quickly shut you down if they don't like your answer. Instead of just being forward and saying we will pay you between this range and this range, does that sound good?

2092,How to not take rejections personally?,[deleted] 
2093,Rejection due to lack of experience,Having experience is unrealistic.. nobody is born with it. Every one has to learn it from someone somewhere. Experience or not you are still going to have to go through some training. I don't ever recall of any employer that just threw me out there without any training just cause I had experience. So it really makes no sense to even having experience in the first place. It's the matter of selling yourself to the company and learning the position fast without giving any hesitation to your supervisor. Most of the time you just got to make a point and show good character. Dont be too uptight during the interview and never try to sugar coat it. What you do and don't know will be discovered eventually... I cant tell you how many times I've seen guys in roles where they have no clue what the hell was even going on and somehow managed to get in. Start networking with friends and family. This can put you in front of the list and make the hiring process go a lot smoother on your end. You will find that a lot of the times it's not about what you know its about who you know. I wish you luck on your job search and all your endeavors! 
2094,Sick of job searching,"Keep going, do your part, keep  trying. Its not  your fault if a a third person/company decides that at this moment you are not a match for them. Keep in mind that the job market has ""seasons"" too, so timing its a factor too. did you try another city/area? You do your part, be in the market, improve yourself, eventually it will come together.

I spent more than a year as an inmigrant looking for a job in Spain, with no savings, and lost my residency because i didnt found a job in the first year and worked for 6 months (Having 10+ years on web and design plus portfolio to back it up)  Later i learned that is not uncommon here to be ""en paro"" (unemployed) for 2-3 years before finding a new job, with your chances dangerously decreasing as you get older.

&#x200B;

PS: If you want to know how the story ends, i got  a crappy job after getting a letter from extranjeria that said ""you have 15 days to leave the country"" , i survived with that job for 3 years, as i almost lost my sanity ( the work that i got was a startup with terrible management, formed by 3 employees and 2 bosses, nobody else survived more than 6 months there, besides me), i managed to fix my residency and started applying for better jobs, in 3 months, i had moved from the city that i was living on with a new, very decent job, wich i still have, 3 years later. My life has changed a lot, for the better, and yours will too. Do your part. "
2095,Curious about a recruiter's response,"It sounds like you didn't interview with them and received this based on a review of your resume/application.  In which case, it sounds like a boilerplate kind note to the individuals not selected to interview for the position.

If I were on top of my game, I would send this email out just to the people who I actually wanted to see again in future jobs, and then a more general ""thank you for applying but you're not being moved ahead"" email to those I didn't want to encourage to apply for more jobs.

It's hard to know necessarily what approach the company took, but if you are taking the time to apply for positions that are a good match for your skills, experience, and interests, then definitely keep the company on your radar and reapply for positions that seem a good fit. "
2096,How do you stay motivated to continue to search?,Find hobbies and friends to take the edge off. Works for me

You may or may not hear back, but if you do then at least you know. It sucks that they did that though... They probably really did like you and then someone a bit better happened to come along. It happened to me before. They told me ""you'll hear back on xday to schedule a secons interview to meet everyone"", as if it were a fact and not just hypothetical, and I never heard back.

2106,Is it wrong to apply to a part-time movie theater job again after not hearing back from the initial interview? I have met two managers there and I thought I left a relatively good impression on each.,Should be fine. The worst they can say is no.

Things like this that are completely out of your control are the most frustrating, but also what you have to let go of the most. It's really hard not to take it personally, but you really just have to look forward to other opportunities and take this as a learning experience. "

2112,Young male looking for help with following-up and finding mental stability,"There's always going to be rejection - you just have to be resilient. I looked through some of your previous comments - looks like you have some coding experience. It was suggested that you look into  [https://www.khanacademy.org/](https://www.khanacademy.org/) .  That was about a year ago.  I'm guessing Programming is your field?

Be diligent, if you got an interview you're sure to get another one. Post in all the conventional places but also think outside the box:

* Local chamber of commerce
   * Ask if you could leave a resume or if they know of anyone looking for an intern or entry level person
* School Guidance Counselor
* Community college job board
* Public Library

Hang in there & stay positive. Good luck!! "
2113,6 months of applying and almost zero interviews,"If you have experience and not getting interviews, your resume needs work "
2114,What am I doing wrong?,"In addition to the other comments, is suggest reaching out to the interviewer after they rejected you. I did this a few times, asking if they can make time to provide me productive feedback, so I can improve on my interview skills and better understand my skill gaps. This process helped me how to perform better in future interviews as well as be prepared to talk about my gaps in a positive light. "
2115,"After months of searching, I found my dream job. 17 days later I was let go.","Im like you. In  that i’ll come in and say hey i have great ideas to fix this inconsistency or flaw. 

But if you do your ob too well, you could end up with people losing their job bc of your “fix.” 


Then you get praise, someone gets scolded, and some get let go. 

I have damaged the work dynamic before bc of this. Fun times. "
2116,Didn't get the job after two rounds of interviews. Thought they went well. Any advice?,"Sometimes there are several good final candidates but only one job. You just have to pick one.   
It doesn't mean that you did anything wrong, it just means that either the other candidate was really good or that it was a close call and there was something specific that the other person did or said that made them pick them. Maybe it even was blind luck- they had to pick one and it ended up being the other person. That's something that can happen even if you did everything perfectly. "
2117,Consistent late responses after job interview.,"That is pretty rough, I'm sorry to hear.  Keeping pushing forward.  

As for how typical these may be, not hearing back by when they say they'll get to you is pretty common.  Hell it even happens to the person that ends up getting the gig sometimes.  Timelines are always incorrect.  The rejection after your mini project doesn't sound too unusual either.  I've been a part of hiring processes where we've had to give three people assignments and reject two of them.

For the second interview, I will say that typically references are requested from the person they're most interested in making the offer to.  For companies doing it ""right"", it's usually the last step right before an offer, so I'm kinda surprised one didn't come your way.  To your knowledge, did they request your references as a final step? "
2118,Is it a wise to apply to a new position opening in a company listing right after your application for another postion (within the same company) is rejected?,Does the resume you sent in for the first job cover this new jobs requirements as well?

2124,Needing some input or suggestions concerning job hunt or resume,"My sympathies for your situation. I can only imagine how stressful 12 months of unemployment must be. 

If you haven't already, could you contact your county workforce development department and ask for a resume/cover letter review and access to its job database? Additionally, could you join a MeetUp or Facebook group to provide feedback, support and networking opportunities? 

Have you done any research on companies where you would like to work? I know people have found success with informational coffee meetings to discuss what businesses are looking for in employees and such. 

Again, I feel for your situation and wish you great success for your next job. "
2125,My SO is frustrated with her string of extremely short term jobs. Has anyone else dealt with this problem?,Has she had other jobs before? Usually temp assignments like reception and admin are rather easy and they never expect much form a temp for the first month. There must be something she’s doing wrong or projecting the wrong impression of herself. Like saying inappropriate jokes or something. 
2126,"Didn’t get the job, but recruiter invited me to stay in contact. Is this just a nice thing to say to a rejected candidate or should I actually try to stay in contact?","Like the others said, it's an empty gesture. I tried to contact the recruiter I worked with during my previous interview process with the company about another position that they have open. Never heard back. Either she didn't think I wasn't a fit and didn't want to tell me, didn't want to bother with it, or no longer works with the company.

Another recruiter at a different company told me to keep in touch so I can apply for the next application cycle. Next application cycle came, sent an email expressing my interest, got a reply WEEKS after saying that he no longer works in that department but will pass my resume along. One follow up and two weeks later, still nothing. The application cycle probably has moved forward enough for me to be able to apply anyways. "
2127,"Applied to Spirit Halloween and got this, any current employees have the same problem?","**I know this is old, but.**

I really didn't like the Spirit Halloween app system. I wasn't even in the system my first day of work, and had to go home and reapply. The store manager allowed me to work that day and get paid though.  I think this happens if you applied to a job as some other sites that use talentReef do this to me too.

I then went home, reapplied, and called him to get into the system and was able to do onboarding from there.

  Also, I do gotta warn you that at least at my location you're hardly gonna get many hours and it does not pay a lot. I am working one shift a week and am pretty sure this will likely change when Halloween approaches closer. "
2128,"I'm so stressed and depressed. Application after application, rejection after reject. Time to give up?","I don't think you should give up, assuming that's the field you want.  You're getting interviews, so people seem to be interested in what you have to offer.

I""m sure the degree isn't useless, but I guess it depends on exactly what type of job you're targeting.   I think it would be helpful to go to people you know in your field, could be old professors, people who do the kind of work you want to do and ask them what to do.  Colleges often have alumni career counseling that can help with resumes, interview skills etc. that you can use well after graduation. "

I'd suggest finding someone to fall madly in love with you (who is a citizen!) and getting married asap. Problem solved

2134,I was just denied a job because of defaulted student loans after a credit check. Is this common?,[deleted] 
2135,Reapplying for a job I was rejected to last year,"Reapply and reach out. There were a lot of times when I was the second choice for a candidacy and didnt get chosen, but I kept in contact with them and reached out for other positions. At the very least, it will show your continued interest in the company. It's gotten me some interviews again and other times it didnt. "
2136,"After phone screening, was told about upcoming interview. Seemed to be ghosted, asked for update and now received a generic rejection","I doubt it's the salary range. They usually line up a few candidates, and have preferred one, if the top candidate accept the offer, they send out rejection letter otherwise they will ask the next candidate. They may have interviewed a few people before you, so things moved further. "
2137,What am I doing wrong? Always get rejected after interviews,"Often times, ""it's not you, it's them"". Either companies are very selective or they have to go through the entire interview process so they could select someone internally. 

>I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong. I have three bachelors degrees and a masters, so I definitely meet qualifications.

And yet Google hired an ex-con as their software engineer. I would choose you because you chose to ""enrich yourself"" path rather than ""I fucked up  so I'll go take a coding course so Google has a better image"" path. "
2138,Rescinded job offer. What to I tell potential employers?,"Look up PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL for the point of law on this. In the UK, you don't even need to claim promissory estoppel as it is now a simple breach of contract, following the precedent of McCann v Snozone Ltd 2015 (easily found via search engines). That ruling clarified that an offer made at interview - even a phone interview - is binding, and as such the contract can only be terminated by mutual agreement. In that particular case, the Tribunal awarded the claimant a month's pay - even though the poor guy never even started. 

 I cannot say if the law is the same in other countries but it does seem as though the same applies in the USA:

https://www.lawyers.com/legal-info/labor-employment-law/job-hunting/promises-and-rescinded-job-offers.html

Future employers don't need to know, it's none of their business. You were never employed by that company so it's irrelevant. "

2140,How do you get over job rejection?,drink 
2141,One thing I have consistently learned the hard way: the only way to know if you have gotten the job is if you get an offer,"This is bad (or at least incomplete) advice. 

After the interview, no matter how good it went, follow up with a hand-written thank you note and a call a few days later. Express interest in the job and remind them of how excited you are about potentially working there. 

DO NOT just move on and forget it ever happened like you don't expect to get the job. If they're on the fence and you do these two things, you'll come out ahead. "
2142,"Mental problems after sexual assault has left a gap in my CV, and now no one will hire me.","You could try to appeal for sympathy from interviewers/hiring managers. You need to be able to ""read the room"" pretty well to know when it's a good idea or not, but when it is, it works! I've landed a couple jobs (when I was younger) by being honest about my situation and asking for a chance to prove my value. Being young and having a story that tugs at people's heartstrings helps, and as an assault survivor you definitely have that. Make it work for you instead of holding you back. "
2143,"Got offered a job, and then the company changed their mind",Follow up with the company to ask why. 
2144,What Am I Doing Wrong?,Sometimes a company is not a good fit and yes sometimes they will want you to go above and beyond your job description. My best advice is to read some articles on how to apply for a job and resume writing. Also use indeed and Glassdoor to check out what current and former employees are saying about the company that you are applying for.

2148,Why am I being denied for basic jobs that I know I'm qualified for?,"Everyone applies for admin jobs as they are seen as better than retail work. As admin is automated and outsourced offshore, there will be far fewer jobs about. "
2149,Rejected after a paid lunch,I would call them and ask for feedback. Pretty standard stuff.

2151,Best way to keep positive during the hunt?,"workout everyday, you dont need a gym, go for runs at the park or do body weight exercises i.e. pushups. Spend only 2-3 days a week looking for jobs, dont search everyday because you will get burned out. With your other free time maybe take some classes online on udemy, they are like only $15.

always be sure to set aside time to socialize with friends/family but dont overdue it . "
2152,Previous manager won't give my girlfriend a reference - advice needed,">So my question is: is there anything she can do in future (or to respond to this job offer that was rescinded)? 

What did she say when they asked for ""reference from your previous manager""?

It is okay to give one of the previous managers (ask them) from when she was a model employee. "
2153,Failed my first job interview ever—advice?,"i know this was posted a week ago but everyone has failed an interview at least once and those who say they haven't are liars. you're human and it's bound to happen. take those small failures and turn them in to a learning experience. the more interviews you do, the more you expect what questions you'll be asked and the more you can anticipate those questions, the better you can be prepared to answer them well "
2154,How do I turn down a job offer after salary negotiation?,I wouldn’t write an email. I would call and speak to them. Just be upfront and honest. And courteous. 
2155,Have you ever just been bad at a job ?,my whole career 
2156,"Rejected, but encouraged to apply for other positions. Sincere or standard BS?",That's just a standard rejection thing. Seen it in 3 e-mails over the last couple weeks. 
2157,Rejected because I didn’t have an “adaptable skillset”,"It could be one of their form letters but it could also give you some good information. I would think about your responses to their questions. If they asked you typical behavioral questions, like ‘tell me about a time you did X’ or ‘ how would you handle X situation’ and you struggled to answer, it could be an indication that you haven’t thought through how your skills or experience clearly relate to the job requirements. If that’s the case, sit down and do that. Write it out if you need to and practice your answers so they are clear but sound genuine. "
2158,Could some interpret this email I just received...did I just get rejected?,"That is a rejection. It’s a vague one, but it’s definitely a rejection. If it were automatically sent when you applied, it might not be a rejection, but based off the fact that two weeks have went by, that means someone put your application in the “no” pile which triggered that email. "
2159,Got fired from a medical marijuana cultivation site and now having troubld getting a job,"Put something about plants/crops or “farming” lol, leave out the word marijuana. "
2160,Give me and others a bit of hope.,"Sounds familiar, I also have experience teaching abroad, and domestically (I'm in the US).

I finished my Masters (English at a mediocre university) in May, during which I had a paid internship. They weren't able to spin up a job for me after I graduated, but they gave me a contract for a short-term project through them that ran out in mid-July. I finally landed a temp position that runs til February at an office doing stuff I'm interested in and getting paid well enough. I'm pretty grateful, even though it's temporary... It's been a rough, unsteady 5 months!

Going back to graduate school was a great decision as it gave me so much room to grow and try professions other than teaching and working in restaurants. If you're interested and it's an option for you, you could apply to graduate programs, and once you get in, do whatever you can to try and get an (ideally paid) internship somewhere and that'll get you going, for sure. Getting a master's didn't automatically generate a job for me, and frankly, I don't think the degree itself is doing too much for me, though it doesn't hurt. The paid internship I had in the office, and the short term project they had me on after it was over, has been really helpful in job interviews as it shows I have office experience.

A lot of graduate programs in the US have tuition waivers that you can get after your first year by teaching a class, tutoring, etc. I imagine it's similar in the UK. "
2161,Anyone ever had the experience of applying to a job but your friend got the offer instead?,"Yep.  Been there, and honestly, yeah, it's hard not to be disappointed that you didn't get the offer.  The way I see it though, we both interviewed, and my friend had a skill-set more suited to the company.  Congratulate her, and maybe you can get some tips from it - ask how she responded to particular questions you found difficult etc.  Maybe you could have a peek at her CV?  

Remember, it's not her fault that the company turned you down - it's not something *she* had any control over - she applied, interviewed, and got the position in fair circumstances. "
2162,Should I phone back this employer?,"Honestly, I’ve started to tell recruiters that I’ve gotten a job offer from Recruiter 1, 2, &3. Did that with all of my recruiters that I’ve signed up for. Eventually I started getting more interviews-within a week of doing that, I got a job offer. 

It sped them up a little. It made each of them work under pressure, compete, and get me an offer to score the commission. 

Maybe do the same with your employers 1 & 2.

As the saying goes “Fake it till you make it.” Sometimes that includes lying or embellishing your facts. "
2163,Did I mess up somewhere in the interview process?,"It was probably the cargo shorts and flip flops.

Seriously.  If you can identify some glaring social problem, that's one thing, but sometimes better matches just come up.  Or, people already have a known quantity in mind and they just have to go through the process before accepting someone they'd already identified for the position.  Not a direct reflection on you. "
2164,Am I the only one who gets annoyed by that?,This usaily happen right after you tell them how much money you want to make 
2165,Multiple interviews but no offers... are you always the problem?,"My situation is somewhat similar. My job ended in May (layoff in second round, just found out the company did round three), and I've had 6 interviewing companies and 6 rejections. In at least three of these I know they went with internal referrals, and one someone had experience in a specialized area I did not (not anything specified as even a desirable thing in the job description. Due to the industry I'm in a lot of the jobs I apply for are through specialized placement places, so I can get some feedback). I have an interview on Tuesday, and this one I'm being referred from a current employee, so maybe that is the way in for me.

&#x200B;

I don't know if I'm the problem, I too, have been told I""m an amazing interviewee and bring samples. I did register today with a place that helps those looking for work write resumes, hone in LinkedIn profiles, practice interview, etc. It's federally funded, so free for me, so perhaps if I don't get the job I'm interviewing for on Tuesday, this will help. "
2166,Reapply to same job after not passing assesment,"Why not, if you have the time and you’re keen I don’t see why you shouldn’t. Just make sure to make sure you hit all key areas of the job spec and that can include specific wording. "
2167,"Chemical engineer, Can't find a job. What else should I do? looking for advice.","There are plenty of jobs in chemical engineering right now.  You need to be open to move and take an entry level job anywhere to gain some experience.  

If there is a specific plant you are looking to work for - take an operator job and work there for a year.  That alone will score you a lot of points and I know a few people who have done so.  One guy they even offered him an engineer job on the spot for his willingness to go on shift. "
2168,"Been unemployed for months, blowing through savings just to survive.",That's what savings are for. 
2169,Terminated 13 years ago still being held against me.,"Say no to that question in the future. I've had jobs where my leaving was more a mutual decision, but I've never been fired, but the technical answer to the way that is worded would be yes for me. I've always just said no and no job has EVER double checked even when a background check has been done. There comes a point when you are being overly honest to your own detriment. "
2170,Bad idea to reapply for a job that ended in rejection 2 months earlier?,"Bad idea. If they didn't hire you the first time then they're not gonna hire you the second time. 

Just let it go. "
2171,Company blew off my references and finally got back to me 2 months later.,
2172,"Constantly Rejected, Really Low Self-Esteem","If you’re going for retail positions, then the walk-in approach is going to be several times more effective than online forms. I’d bet that over half your online apps aren’t even being read by humans. Call in and try to schedule an appointment with a manager if possible and tell them what you want and/or ask what they’re looking for. Do this at any and every local business and you will get some results eventually. "
2173,Have you ever responded to a rejection email?,I responded to one recently. I thanked them for getting back to me to let me know where I stood. I really wanted that job and I was gutted not to get the offer. I wanted to sound polite and mature— and to maybe keep the door open for the future when I had a few more years’ experience. 
2174,"Did I make a mistake in communicating with this prospective employer who seemed interested in me, or was I just unlucky?","You did nothing wrong. You were articulate and professional in your responses and I think you handled it perfectly. 

Sometimes hiring employers run hot and cold. They can be very flaky and you are left wondering why they went from very interested to giving you the brush off. The best answer here is not to obsess over it and mentally move on. This one is 100% on them. "
2175,"I didn’t get the job, but I got something better than a denial email",I get especially disappointed when I don't even get a sniff on a job that I know I'm perfect for.  They have no idea what they've lost out on. 
2176,Feeling So Defeated from Job Search,"Been in the same boat, sorta. It's exhausting.

And the reason it's hard is because you're not entry level. You're not getting scooped up with a bunch of new hires - you're gunning for specific positions with competition.

They say expect a month of search for every 10k you make. "
2177,Job Application Appeal Request: Is it too much to go through each qualification one by one?,"Also remember that there are many different ""watch-dog"" groups mandating that a certain percentage of employees/hires MUST meet pigeon-hole demographics.  If you  do not ""meet"" today's quota you get, ""... very sorry, you did not meet our needs for this position.""

It is nothing you did or didn't do, and that is the problem in many job/career markets in 2019. "
2178,Can my job make me kill a Mouse/Spider/Etc,">I'm asking this because i dont agree with killing animals like that.

Sorry I don't know about your question and I cannot add anything useful to your question,but I just want to say that I really respect you for having this trait. Thanks, I guess "

2183,I start my first job tomorrow (always in remote and full time). What are some good tips for starting this new job and my career?,"Books are a great way for this. ""Start with why"" by Simon Senek is a good book. Also, try to understand what the problem is and research books, blogs for solutions.

Don't hesistate to formalize your skill as much as possible. Say u r doing project management, try obtaining PMP. This may or may not help at ur current job but most certainly will increase ur skill transferability.

Another advice is to look at actively managing your personal finance by making good decisions. FIRE reddit community is a good start for this. "
2184,"My department restructured and I lost all higher level responsibilities, what should I feel?",They soured on you for some reason. 
2185,Any tips on how to not forget to clock out? I've done it twice in two weeks!,"Sorry to sound condescending but you’re stressed from a 4 day work week?  Also maybe to help not forget to clock out would be to miss the hours on your next pay cheque and not have managers hold your hand. Maybe time to be an adult. If we forget to clock/sign out at work we get called back in to do so and that sucks on a Friday night. 

I know I sound like a dick but it helps a lot of people remain accountable in our work place. "
2186,"How do I get over being fired, even when it’s been a year or two?","It’s in the past.

Move on and think about all the great things you have to look forward to. You’re past shouldn’t define you.

I’ve done things in the past that I look back on and think ‘whoa, that was bad’. Live and Learn. "
2187,Are jobs as really bad as my parents make them out to be?,"I loved fast food. Free food and my coworkers were always great. We had fun, laughed, mocked the angry customers who got mad for small reasons, etc. For a teen or someone in school, it can be a fun job with hours to fit your needs. Yeah you have to clean, but it isn't horrible. You are given what you need to clean. Sometimes it will be nasty, because fast food customers can be super disgusting, but you will have to clean at almost any job you get in as a teen. "
2188,Life With Company After PIP,"In Ask HR, someone asked about the circumstances surrounding the illness. I'm more interested in the long-term impacts of the PIP at my current company, but if the info is relevant, here was my response:

I was scheduled to co-present at an international conference. Since mid-month, I'd had what I thought was a really bad cold at the time (I tested negative for the flu so my doctor attributed it to being a cold) and I told my supervisor that I wasn't sure if if was a good idea for me to travel. She told me I needed to ""deal with it"" and that not attending wasn't an option.

The deadline I missed was related to a non-exigent writing project that she assigned me the last day I was there. I fully intended on completing it between sessions, but ended up sleeping longer than expected while laying down to rest. The next day I told her I needed some additional time since I had little energy due to the cold, and she got extremely upset. A few days later the PIP was created.

I'll also add - my condition worsened while I was there, which I told her about as well, but she discouraged me from seeing a doctor and asked me to self-medicate since I needed to be present at each session of the 5-day event (she said something about not letting a cold be an excuse).

It wasn't until mid-March that I realized that I may have had covid-19, but at this point there's no reliable way to test that. "
2189,What are most important lessons which you have learnt in your work life?,My number one thing I learned is to KEEP WORK AND YOUR PERSONAL LIFE SEPARATE. I didn’t do that at one job and we all got really chummy and it was such a terrible environment with so much backstabbing and gossip. I even had a coworker crash a date I had told them I was going on and they sat right next to me and my date so they could listen in. At more recent jobs I’m friendly but I don’t give any real details about my life and keep those two worlds separate. 
2190,asking for time off?,"Start with asking people you work with if they would be willing to cover your shifts.  Then take this to your manager.

Hey boss, I'm  going on a trip next week from Sunday to Saturday.  I spoke with Larry, Moe, and Curly and they would like to pick up my shifts if that is okay with you. "
2191,Am I at fault?,Oregon law states that employers must pay schedules two weeks in advance for this very reason. 
2192,Help for measurable PIP objectives for ‘subjective’ performance?,"It sounds like you need to clarify expectations for the role, and this person's place within the team/organization. Only then can you actually measure their performance.

A PIP without measurable objectives may make the employee feel that it's being done in bad faith, as a means to fire the employee. If you really want to make this person improve I'd really think about whether you've actually been coaching them, or if they interpreted the micromanagement to mean they're not allowed to act independently. An honest conversation, and listening, may help you to determine this. This kind of PIP will just serve as a signal the employee needs to look for another job, which may be the desired outcome if they're not a good fit for this role.

2196,Can you be fired for a customer exaggerating events because they're upset?,They can fire you but usually in retail they won't fire you over little things like that. Especially if it was a false accusation and with the pandemic going on. That old lady was an ***. 
2197,What do about tedious job routines? Any data entry workers here are welcome to provide tips or advice.,"I'm not exactly data entry (or maybe I'm just in denial), but blocking out your time does help!


As well, I don't know if its an option for you, but for me, I work better with music in the background- it helps me focus.


 If there are any failsafes you can implement with your work to help reduce errors, that also helps- I'm in A/R for a mid sized company, so I keep a lot of spreadsheets tracking who has what for review, when things were sent out, any notes I receive back, and the like. Having somewhere to put information when it's fresh, to refer back to later, helps me a lot- for  example, when you get a request for a report, could you put it in a spreadsheet with report identifier/date requested/department to send to, and refer back to it when you're ready to send? "
2198,Burnout for my role has left me crippled and almost 0% productivity available. Help.,
2199,How to balance workload in having 2 full time jobs?,"         Leave the job that pays the least amount. Ultimately it’s up to you if you want to get fired for incompetence by sleeping on the job, but be my guest, it’s your funeral. I’m sure that people would understand if you quit the remote job after the outbreak is over, this is a weird situation. I had a job when I was in high school working the night shift. I needed a job in December last year, because my mom and dad did not wanna pay my rent after high school and it was rough. They expect me to live paycheck to paycheck and be able to pay rent when I’m working fifty hours a month and only making nine hundred dollars doing it. I had to save for after high school, so I know what it’s like to get out of school at 4 o’clock in the afternoon and drive half an hour to work at 10 in the evening, only to get off work sometimes at 4 o’clock in the morning, drive home, and get about 3 hours of sleep before I have to drive my brothers and I to school before 9am. I had to do that, and you don’t have to after the virus. "
2200,Is it ok to call off/go home sick for anxiety or mentally not feeling well?,"So I work in a grocery store too, anyone who called in sick even if it's a general feeling of  being unwell hasn't been scheduled  and wont be  until this  is  over. You dont have to disclose with your employer that its anxiety based ,  but  be prepared to not be scheduled for a while. "
2201,What I learned from getting laid off from a basic administrative assistant job,There are a lot of folks in sucky jobs that would jump earlier if the economy had better paying jobs. Yang’s #FreedomDividend gives workers extra FU money to make it easier. 
2202,How to fix my attitude about work?,The only real difference between you (as an employee) and an independent contractor is that you only have one customer: your employer. 
2203,"How bad is it to get a ""verbal discipline""?","""Verbal discipline"" seems like a pretty vague term--it could mean a lot of things.

A good boss gives feedback and if they do it correctly you know where you stand, what you are doing well, and what you need to improve. Getting feedback doesn't automatically mean you are on the path to getting fired--it can be normal throughout your job.

On the other hand, it also possible that ""verbal discipline"" is the result of a something serious that could put you in the path to being fired.

It is really hard to tell from the description what kind of situation you are in. "

That said, if you like to work alone or can go to a co working space a few times a week or have things at home that require you to be there, do it, it’s really a personal choice. "
2206,Can my boss leave me off the schedule?(california),"in my experience, when they leave you off the schedule in food service, it's an attempt to passively terminate you.  one week could be whatever - if it goes into two or three, you know what to do.

of note, if you apply for unemployment as a result of reduced hours, they'll deny it on the basis that you 'quit' and you'll have to appeal.

bottom line:  i'd say to start looking. "
2207,So My Boss Yelled At Me Today,"Guy seems pretty reasonable in that he apologized to you afterwards, I've been yelled at plenty by bosses over dumb things such as that when I'm just trying to do my job and never once do they own up to it. 

I would just communicate what you told us to him, because of the previous pranks and your lack of experience you are struggling with whether or not he's joking and its making you hesitate to do things like this specific issue with the sushi. "

Well you are going to have to make time too. Because feelings drive a lot of the office politics that you see before you. 

""I know I am going wrong somewhere here, and I'd like to know how I can change my way of thinking, and what is the best way to approach situations like this?""

Best thing to do I say, is stay in your lane and dont worry about other peoples fluff ups. And keep in mind that people are sensitive. That makes people dangerous. Avoid direct confrontation at all times with all people unless you know for certain that it would save you in particular situations. "

I want to work on my appearance, how I talk, and my capacity for applying for jobs in my field (geosciences). What are the first steps?",You can always try to spin your retail work by stating the soft skills you learned from them onto a more professional setting. Like how you learned to work well in a team or take the initiative/be proactive. Communication is always a valuable trait to have in any work setting. 
2214,Do I need to be a people person to work insurance/sales?,"I do not think you have to be a ""people"" person to be good a sales, but you do need to know how to build relationships.

My job requires me to speak with people majority of the day but when I am not at work, I do not like talking to people. "
2215,Will I get fired (or someone from my team)?,"Middle manager: clearly the route of the problem. Hopefully more likely to be fired or reassigned than anyone else.

Big boss: heard about the complaint and is being over the top and exaggerated in responding to it. They seem to be shifting things toward the most junior analyst, possibly to protect the middle manager over her. This is the one you seem to trust that you maybe should be wary of. But I don't think you're in danger of being fired by him.

Junior analyst: was and is being mistreated. It's unclear if she gave you a more honest version of the HR complaint or if HR did, but if you've otherwise had a decent relationship with her (and haven't been dismissive of her like some of your posts kind of imply, but it's unclear), it seems like HR either misunderstood who the problem was because of unclear hierarchy or they also want it to not be the fault of this middle manager. It's also quite possible she vented about each little thing and maybe HR latched on. 

If you've heard nothing else from HR, I wouldn't worry about your job, but I would look into switching teams, away from big boss if possible. "
2216,"I’m so effing tired of jobs expecting you to stay late and work off the clock unpaid, then getting upset when you walk in a few minutes late.","I'm confused. So you are complaining that you are working 4 9-hour shifts? That's not even 40 hours if you end up staying 30 minutes extra.  


Is it salary or hourly? Also, take your break. I skip my breaks because my employer is cool and I just skip breaks and lunch so I can leave early every day. But if an employer is a dick then you should definitely strictly enforce your legal right to a break.  


If you are a recruiter or something then you know well the importance of both parties being up front about expectations. They made it clear that their culture and unofficial policy was to to get your work done even if that meant staying over. That also means that if you can get your daily work done faster you can leave on time or early. "
2217,I got suspended from work for breaking a company policy. Need some advice for moving forward.,Your big mistake was admitting that you did it. For all you know they asked that to every employee. If they don't have actual evidence it was you it would just been their word against yours so now you messed up and now your gonna get fired. Good luck explaining this in your next job interview. Your gonna need it. 
2218,Anxious about starting a new job after a long time not working/long spell of depression,How did it go? 
2219,(Probably) Fired for Lateness,"it won't follow you for the rest of your life, but can't you just set your alarm ten minutes earlier?

by the way, i doubt they intend to fire you for being 5/10 minutes late every day lately (typically you don't get a few days' notice of your term; it typically comes from out of absolutely nowhere) - you are probably just going to get firmly scolded.  if that turns out to be the case, make NO excuses, acknowledge the failing, and assure them you'll improve - and then improve.

on the off-chance you DO get termed, no, i wouldn't leave this off your resume given the length of tenure.  if that happens, come back here and ask for advice on how to explain the term to future prospective employers.

but again - i doubt that's what's about to happen.  and again - improve your timeliness immediately, starting monday.  if you're 5-10 minutes late every day that is an easy problem to solve; wake up slightly earlier and plan better for traffic or whatever is causing the tardiness.  chronic tardiness is fucking annoying to everyone you work for and with, and if you think it's petty, think of every time you've had a doctor's appointment, arrived on time or early, and sat in the waiting room for 20 minutes, or the time you showed up at opening time somewhere and the doors were still locked.  people are relying on you to be in your seat at a certain time, and you should respect them enough to actually be there. "
2220,How should I respond to HR about issues in my personnel file?,"Well, are you expecting any issues? What issues were you thinking about? It sounds like they just don’t want to deal with you coming back and bothering them with questions or problems. "
2221,Applying for Communications Coordinator position. I need two writing samples. Suggestions?,"If you really want to impress, write something specific to their congregation. Something they could see themselves using. "
2222,"Attitude to work, blue collar and white collar jobs","I've also worn both collar colors. For me the hardest part was internalizing the mindset/culture differences.

In blue collar work, you call a spade a spade, and if you don't like someone, you look them in the eye and say ""fuck you"". To do otherwise would make people call you ""untrustworthy"", ""difficult"", ""shady"", etc.

In white collar roles, doing exactly the same thing would get you fired by 9:01 AM. At first I thought that white collar workers were just good liars, I've since come to understand the difference between lying and bullshitting- misrepresentation of the truth vs. not caring about the truth in the first place. To me, doing well in an office setting requires you to start with a positive mindset, then filter facts & sensory inputs through this filter of positivity until they fit. This took me a long time to get the hang of, there's definitely an art to it.

As for getting ripped on for being ""lazy"" or having soft, clean hands; I found that pretty easy to ""own"", since that's precisely the reason I wanted out of grunt work. If you make a token show of your roots- helping a blue-collar guy at your company check the oil on a forklift or something, changing the oil in your own car in the parking lot- you'll get a ton of respect where it counts. I miss the joking and ribbing in blue collar roles, so thankfully that will never end. "
2223,One of my employees has put his two weeks notice (and changed his mind) four times this summer,I might cut him a little slack (in addition to the slack he’s already been cut) and tell him LAST TIME.  My reasoning is there’s a precedent of forgiveness and expectations need to be clearly established and adhered to starting now! 
2224,How do you get through a long shift at the most boring job?,"By doing your job?

I don't know. "
2225,"Told a co-worker I don’t believe them, can I get in trouble?",Probably not. You didn’t handle the situation well either though. The right thing to do would’ve been to avoid that kind of statement in front of others and have a 1 on 1 to try to address the real issue. This approach just made things awkward and didn’t really address any actual issues. Good luck. 
2226,My co-worker is trying to get me fired.,"That guy lives a miserable existence and believes he can take out his hate and negativity onto you. Never reply to his email without CCing your manager. You can say something like .....
[My manager] is this how we should do this?

Don't talk to him on the phone if you can avoid it. Don't fuel his hate. "
2227,Can an employer discipline for social media?,"If you signed a contract in regards to social media, yes. If not, then no. "
2228,Probation period tips?,"Resist invites on social media, and if you go out for after work drinks only have one light beer. Lay low in other words. There’s plenty of time to get to know your work colleagues. "
2229,Does economics hold the same value as finance when applying to financial analyst jobs?,"If you compare keyword searches between ""economics"" and ""finance"" on Indeed.com you get 10X more job postings for finance. As a recruiter, finance hold more promise in terms of opportunities for sure. "
2230,"So, I'm sick (throwing up and the work) and being threatened to be written up at work","In the US federal law says you get 2 weeks of unpaid leave for family emergencies.  If this company is in the US, they are violating federal employment law.  Start playing hardball. "
2231,I'm a depressed $30 a day worker that needs advice.,Listen to some of Jordan Peterson's lectures or read some his interviews/books. Great insight especially for younger people struggling. 
2232,Can I be fired for being sick even with a doctor's note?,A doctor's note? Why would you need a doctor's note? If your company doesn't trust you enough that they require notes then it doesn't sound like a place I'd want to work. 
2233,Difficulty finding a new job while working one.,"You have to push yourself. There are days it isn't easy. Make yourself a goal, one application a day. Stick to it the best you can. Between commute and work I spend 13 hours a day working. Some days I'll skip my application and do two the following day. After three months of this though I finally got an offer last week. It sucks and it's hard, but stick with it and it will happen. "
2234,"Fired for small infraction, had no idea I was anywhere near separation.","There are two forms of termination: hard and soft.  A soft termination is one where you just are not a fit or capable of doing the work.  This is easily explained and not a career killer.

We let a new hire gracefully resign: no harm, no foul.  He was everything they wanted in a candidate - on paper.  He was an SME (Subject Matter Expert) but didn't want to train others and thought he had made that clear during the interview.  Nobody seems to remember that; it was a soft termination.

A hard termination borders on the criminal.  We recently removed a candidate from consideration when his background check revealed that he was terminated for sexual harassment from his last job.  Thanks for playing. "
2235,Is it me or my targets that are insane?,"While I think you should be looking for a new job, this sounds like something you could automate with a Python script or something :P "
2236,How do you get over feeling like you're getting paid to do nothing?,"You're a middle-upper class white boy living the buis-dev fantasy world.  This society was structured for you.  Browsing the web, taking 2 hour lunches and doing 4 hours worth of work per week is by design.  Enjoy the ride.   You could be stuck as a minority in a slave job (retail, construction, transportation, food industry, etc) or as a foreigner staring at code for 12 hours a day, or as an uneducated young woman walking the streets turning tricks.   This country was designed for you, enjoy the ride.  And for the coming storm of ""you racist, there are plenty of people of color in buis-dev positions"", take a look at the buis-dev world, it's 90% middle-upper class white. "
2237,A good employee is a no-show and won't answer her phone. What should I do?,"Tbh, everyone saying this is a great manager move is kind of being creepy.  Work is where you go to get paid to live your own life.  If someone quits without saying a word, that's on them.  If this person happens to make friends that care for him/her, they can do a welfare check as a friend.

If OP was a friend, his move would be justified.  He was just a boss missing out on an employee he felt was reliable.  I'm guessing that the OP also had some sort of attraction to her as well because if this was some ugly, fat, girl in her late fifties, nobody would care.

The lesson here is that the OP, as a manager, has an obligation to care for his employees to an extent, which is in the boundary of the workplace. "
2238,how do you motivate yourself to write cover letters?,Perhaps the don’t have to be so specific to each job and instead one that can be changed in a few words to accommodate the different job requirements.  The motivation? Money. 
2239,"Game Dev graduate struggling to practice, stay motivated and find work.","In my opinion British uni's leave graduates gravely unprepared and under skilled for jobs when leaving uni. I have a 2:1 in computer science and left IT altogether because I felt like you, and I got offered an opportunity with a career natural gas. "
2240,Am I being paranoid? Is my boss trying to get rid of me?,Honestly it sounds like they’re using you and want to get rid of you. I would pack up and leave you’re too good for them. Teachers are needed so badly now you could find a job anywhere. 
2241,Is a Mutiny at work ever successful?,"This will not be successful and one by one, a way will be found to get rid of everyone involved.  If we are to the mutiny stage, management must know there are issues and have chosen to ignore them. "
2242,Fired because client complained about my sexuality,"Wait they're giving you full compensation for the contract?  Doesn't that mean they're buying you out of your remaining time?  You got to work in Hong Kong (if my experience is any indication its very hard to get placed there as an educator as its prime territory) you're getting paid out so you won't have to worry about bills for awhile and you want to complain about it?  


Be glad you're getting a settlement, some people lose their job and have to grovel for unemployment and spend the next few weeks/months worrying if their going to have to declare bankruptcy.    


Also when your teaching kids you lose some of the rights you might have otherwise because you're a role model, please don't act like being nude is some big expression of pride in being gay, it's not (and that attitude easily set gay rights back by a decade because it made the gay community look like perverts when most of them are normal people).  I hope I don't sound overly harsh here but honestly you've got nothing to complain about. "
2243,"28 years old with BA, but no real work experience or skills",You could see if you can do technical writing. 
2244,Is working too efficiently actually a bad thing?,"As an employer and small business owner. 
NO, it is NOT a bad thing.
In fact if you have a coworker who is less efficient, more lazy. Speak to your boss and or the owner who can see. Use it as a bargaining chip to get that promotion or wage increase. Believe us, we know and can tell who is more important. We rather reward a proven worker. "
2245,How do I tell my supervisor that our new hire is incredibly lazy?,The truth? 
2246,Just got demoted,I would look for another job that’s not fair. 
2247,Anxiety After $500 Mistake,"I work for a bank. We've had people accept fake checks and the resulting loss was 10k or more.

One person didn't verify the customer withdrawing and gave away $1800 to someone we couldn't identify. We just knew it wasn't the same person who owned that account.

Training replacements for people who are generally good at their jobs is a huge expense. Many companies will gladly take a small loss to avoid it. "
2248,Just got warned I’ll get a “talking to” about leaving 15 minutes early the past few days.,Don't be afraid to inject some humanity into the situation. Just let some one know that your normal routine has be disrupted and you had to make some adjustments. Resume your regular departure time when the construction ends. People are usually pretty understanding when offer some context beforehand. 
2249,Are there days in the office when you’ve done minimal/no work? Have you ever put off work for the entire day too?,"Follow the guilty feeling in your gut. If you can get away with blowing off work for a day,  essentially getting paid to do nothing with no immediate repercussions- it could certainly happen again and become a habit. Think of your co-workers diligently working all day and earning the same as you. Think of the people doing physically burdensome work for even less pay than you. Think of the money and time you invested in your education. Think of your long term progress as a skilled person in your field. If you can get your head around all that and STILL smugly enjoy slacking off- seriously check yourself because you're now part of a much bigger problem. "

2252,"Can a member of upper management use his position to have me disciplined for something his wife told him I did, but was never reported to the company directly?",People in power can do what ever they want. That’s the entire perk of being upper management. 
2253,Sometimes PIP's are exactly what they say they are.,"(Assuming it’s a skill issue rather than a will) The objective of the PIP can be for improvement and if there’s significant enough good managers are supportive.

However, HR guidelines vary and some organizations (shitty companies or departments) don’t have as much autonomy. 

Then you’re on the way out. 

That said, it’s wrong to assume nefarious intent in all instances. Good companies would have a disciplinary process prior to formal invite to hearing you can submit your resignation. PIPs often last for min 4 weeks to demonstrate improvement and ability to sustain it. 

Tribunals will want to see the org did everything they could to support you. Hence why I always suggest you ask for as much support as possible, even if you think it’s extreme, you can document it was refused etc. 

Being passive about the whole process is the worst. "
2254,Am I within my rights to leave a shift at the exact finishing time? Please read scenario in description,If it’s a one time thing then stay after just to make them happy. If this is a reoccurring problem then don’t stay any later. 
2255,My manager at my second job is knowingly scheduling me outside my availability and is threatening to write me up,"There is nothing to report up the chain.

You didn't give your location but in pretty much every single place in the US she can schedule to the stores needs (which have changed since you were hired) and you can quit. That's the way it works. 

It's weird that no one else wants daytime hours because that's usually when people want to work so it's usually easy to accommodate people who prefer nights but the reality is that the business needs will always outrank your needs. "
2256,I fear taking a gap year in case I do not find work. Any ways of boosting my chances?,"take the year, once you start a serious job it is so hard to take time off. You will look back in 10 years and really be thankful you took the time, just do something cool with it. "
2257,Just a reminder not to let a poor employer/boss hold you down and hold you back.,Well said that person 
2258,Is your boss allowed to read personal notes you've written to yourself on company time?,"Yea, that seems weird to me.  It's none of the boss's business unless doing this takes significant time away from your work (which it doesn't)... And I wouldn't want to work at a job with the boss constantly looking over your shoulder either.  It would just feel like they don't trust you. "

2260,"Manager set up a meeting for ""Significant Oversight"". HELP.",Please...write a TL/DR so we can get a quick and short version of all of this. 
2261,"Retail Workers: Rewarding Work, just a Side job, or a complete nightmare?","I think that retail, at least at entry level, is great for extroverts who need a flexible way to make some fun income. As a source of your main income, it can be a terrible experience.

I never planned to work in retail, but I had to because I finished a master's and couldn't find a job afterwards. The managment, my coworkers and even the customers are fine. I haven't had any serious trouble at that place. However, going there when you know how much money and work you put on your education is an extremely painful experience.

I'd need to work many hours to be able to live independently, and my quality of life would be very low, as I wouldn't be able to afford proper housing, a vehicle, hobbies that don't involve retail or emergency savings. This is something doable for a short period of time, but takes a toll on your health in the long run. For this reason, I'm doing my best to get out of retail. 

Unfortunately, escaping this position means volunteering and getting low paid gigs on the side to built the experience for a better job. I'm working hard to get into marketing, but this is something that might take time and lots of $$$ that tomorrow I might not have. Entry level retail such as cashier and sales associate is one of the lowest jobs in terms of skills that one can accept, so I wouldn't be able to leverage my experience for something better if I were working full time.

On top of everything, I'm an introvert who likes some challenge. Constantly smiling to customers, asking them the same questions every 5 minutes, folding panties and price tagging bras is an emotionally draining experience.

I can't see anything positive about my retail job except for that I'm making a little bit of money to finally transition to a proper career, which isn't to say much as I wouldn't need thos job if I had succeed to launch as soon as I finished college. Retail provides nothing of value to me. "
2262,Can I be fired for missing work due to heart problems?,"Bare in mind, you would not be fired for missing work due to heart problems; You would be fired for missing work. This distinction is important because it answers your question: ""Can she actually fire me for this"" 

You have been with the company for around 6 months so as you have mentioned, you don't qualify for FMLA. 

If I may ask, how many times did you miss work, what was your process on calling out, when did you provide the doctors notes and what did they say? "
2263,Should I be worried for my job?,Print it out and ask your manager. 
2264,Suspended with Pay,Yeah. This seems like its time to move on. 
2265,Not sure how to approach situation I was hired into (I'm a new manager and one employee doesn't respect me).,"> How do I handle this situation? 

Fire her.  If you say you can't then you aren't really a manager.  They just call you that.

I have had to do it to show that there is a new sheriff   in town. Its Machiavellian but it sometimes has to be done. "
2266,What is the best way to deal with a co-worker who leaves early and makes you do everything?,"Your leverage depends on how willing you are to walk away from the job and how much they value you. If you bring the problem to management's attention, but they know you won't walk and don't value you as much as her, then you're not going to see any progress. 

I'd say bring it up to management and see what they say. If nothing changes, then you have to decide if you can deal with it or if you want to start looking for another job. "
2267,Looking for advice on a particular infraction,"A bit vague. Define ""infraction."" Is it actually serious, or just a minor write up/e-mail reminder about the policy that doesn't go anywhere/do anything? If it is that, let it go.

Also: Is this the first time you've done this? If it is, you've got more of a leg to stand on. How long did it take you to fit it into ""any timeframe?"" "
2268,Given Negative Reivew at New Job Worried About my Future,It’s time for a fruit basket.

I’m ashamed of my work and want to do better, how can I fix this?"," This isn’t advice, but I’m really interested in the role your in and want to know a little more. What does your day consist of? Is this a step to being project manager? "
2271,How do you deal with a nosy/ weird co-worker?,Lol for me I would nickname them dwight. The guy from the office. Because I have co workers who repeatedly go talk to the boss for any small problems. 
2272,"Made a mistake, company lost a client, not sure how to apologise correctly, also am austistic","If they dont think you will improve then youd most likely to get fired so you should prepare for that. Being sorry doesnt change anything, so just prepare to move on. "
2273,Is my boss trying to get me fired?,"As you are learning, workimg doesn't have to be fair.  You had sex with her years ago and things didn't work out and if she wants to take it out on you now, then thats nothing unusual.  Just office politics as usual.  If you want more favorable treatment, I would start looking for a new job.  As long as she is your boss, don't expect to be treated fairly. "
2274,Have I already burned a bridge a supervisor?,"Take this as a lesson learned that next time, go to your supervisor to talk about the situation instead of HR. Going to HR before mediating it with your supervisor is essentially going over their head (since you could of had a chance to have a talk with your supervisor to clear the air) HR is there to protect the company, not to hear about employees complaining about their managers. Once the supervisor finds out about this, it won't be any surprise that they are suddenly going to be critical of your every single move. 

It sounds like there was a misunderstanding from what your supervisor saw vs. what you were actually doing. I would take some time to go to your supervisor on your next shift and apologize for whatever miscommunication was experienced and that you overreacted on your first day by going to HR. "
2275,Toxic work environment situation. Is it my fault?,"I'm sorry to hear you're going through this.  It appears to me you handled it the best you can for the most part.  What I would do differently is stop going to the manager from here on out.  You've stated your case, you've shown evidence, they've done nothing about it.  

Document everything.  Every word she says and every meeting thus far; every refusal to give you the equipment you need to do your job, etc.  It is very hard and it will feel like you're reliving it but it is so important to do this.  The reason for this is so that if this place decides they want you out and you can't find another job quickly, you have proof of what happened.  You can consider filing for unemployment, or suing if you find out you have legal grounds (unfortunately bullying still isn't illegal but if the harassment gets especially nasty or there is other evidence of legally-protected harassment/hostility such as racism, sexism, etc. you might end up having a case). 

If you end up out of a job or decide to leave, consider hiring a professional reference-checking company to see what they say about you (something I should've done) and have that conversation about what they plan on telling future employers about you so that you can be on the same page when job-hunting if you list the job in your history.  

In the meantime, when she tells you how to do your job, go ahead and tell her politely but firmly that you know how to do it.  Don't JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain).  She's not your boss.  Doing this with a toxic person just feeds the fire and oftentimes that's all they're really looking for is attention.  That said, it's a good idea to remember how dangerous people who have been honing their socially predatory skills since grade school can be.  Keep your distance, remain polite, do your job but definitely keep your distance.  I can't stress that enough.  Take the time to separate yourself from this stress outside of work and take care of yourself; sleep well, eat well and get enough exercise.  

Also if you're on Facebook there is a group called Workplace Dignity (they also have a blog) with people dealing with these issues in their lives.  

There are other pages on Facebook and also elsewhere online against workplace bullying such as the Workplace Violence Prevention Institute, Healthy Workplace Bill advocates in many states (I used to follow Massachusetts for example which posted many very informative articles and insight into workplace bullying).  I hope this helps! "
2276,Told I was full time but I’m not?,"You might be able to apply for partial unemployment benefits due to your hours being reduced so severely. In the meantime, start looking for a better place to work. "
2277,Can you rejected from a job because you don't look good?,Depends on what kind of job it is. If you're ugly you can forget about making a living by holding bottles of overpriced champagne and sparklers in air.  
2278,Is This Harassment?,"No this is the American education system.

2281,"One month & 3 days on the job, already being threatened with termination","Why are you trying to blame other people for your performance? How about instead of complaining and trying to throw people under the bus, you take initiative  and ask for was to improve.

2282,I (F22) am nervous that I might get fired over 20 dollars. I need advice.,"Not sure on your jurisdiction, influencing hr policy. This is not a sackable offence. They will need to prove misconduct. I’m in banking industry.

You didn’t do this intentionally and as you’ve said there’s mitigating circumstances and proof (camera) should they require it.

Even if you have it to a customer (because clearly you don’t pocket it), mistakes happen. At worst I’d expect a performance improvement plan, but a one off instance, shouldn’t be cause for concern. 

Management will need to follow HR policy. You should always understand your rights.

Edit: regarding focusing. You might want to take notes / checklist (end of day) of tasks you need to complete. When handling customers, deal with customer everything else can wait unless it’s a bank robbery haha... oh yea you’re anxious! That’s a non issue! It as a joke "
2283,"Sexually harassed, no one seems to care.",">I was then pulled into HR again that evening. I made it clear to my HR department that I wanted nothing to do with this person and refuse to even work with them. How am I supposed to work with someone who makes unwanted sexual comments about me and wants me and the woman I love to die and thinks we deserve to die? I'm willing to quit my job if I have to work with that person again, and I have informed my HR the same (I am getting training in a different department currently until sometime in September). They pretty much just told me that I don't have to interact with this person and that they hope I don't have to quit. They said they ""handled it"" and that I don't have to interact or speak with this coworker, but they are still making me work next to her in September. Doesn't that count as interaction? We would be standing next to or across from the other. They still expect me to continue to work next to this person once my training is over and I simply refuse. I just don't think any of this should be tolerated, and they seem to not actually be doing anything about it. To be honest, personally I do think she should be fired because I don't think this should be tolerated at all, but I would feel so much better if I could just move to a different part of the factory, I don't really have that option unless someone else quits.

HR's legal responsibility is to make sure that the harassment stops.  It is not to make sure that you never have to be in the same room with this person again.  They cannot and should not tell you what they have done to your coworker as a consequence.

You do not get to decide how they sanction a coworker.  Emailing the head of HR makes you look, frankly, unstable and like someone I would not want to keep around.

And to those who say: HR is not your friend.  That is very true.  It's also true that your manager is not your friend.  The chief custodian is not your friend.  The CFO is not your friend.  Work is for friendly interaction but not friends.

Finally, quit having your SO contact your coworkers.  Things that happen at work are between you and work.  Again, it makes you look unstable and like a liability. "
2284,Got sent home from work early,"What was the circumstance of the argument?

2285,Bosses are funny,That is strange. Could be good leadership if he wasn’t so angry about it. Does he think you will expect to flex time or come in late this next morning or something? 
2286,How to stop assuming everything needs to be done ASAP? [Discipline],"In my industry, people often ask for something with the attitude that you’re already late delivering it! LOL it’s very much a “getting things done at the 11th hour” & “hurry up and wait” type of industry. I think doing things right away will actually be a benefit in the long run as the longer you are at the job the more responsibilities will pile up.... and it becomes a bigger risk to procrastinate... also I’ve learned the hard way that procrastination leads to anxiety... so you’d be right back where you started. So me the question is about priority. If you ask a “when would you like this done” ... every person will respond saying ASAP because they don’t have any concept of what you are working on at that very moment. I’d strategically ask your question about deadline in a way that also asks which is the real priority... so saying “I will get this done. I’m currently working on XYZ and have X hours more to finish it. I expect I can get this to you by X time. Does that work for you?” 
This will remind them what you are working on AND gives them the opportunity to say “yes that time frame works” or “no I need you to do this first”. Either way you get the real answer you need and not the generic go to answer of “asap”. It also manages up which is a great way to communicate your efforts without blatantly saying “I did This, This, and This, today”. 

Then with time you’ll get a real sense of what is actually pressing and what’s not, but always a good idea to manage up regardless. :) hope that helps!  "

Quick jab aside. Sounds like your enviroment is a shit hole. Generally call center work pays well enough for low level work but they treat you like crap because you are incredibly replaceable. The job is not difficult. You query a database they give you to answer customers, fidget with customers account, act like you have all the answers, and place people on hold. Many of the items you will discuss with customers have scripts. Those jobs are easy and pay enough that the company can fire some one for minor issues and have them replaced in a short amount of time.

You have been studying. What have you been studying? Why not look for low level work in the field you actively study so you can leverage that experience with the end results of your studies to propel you into a career position?

You should get another job. Any manager that thinks they have the right to yell, scream at, or berate a worker for not coming in when they're obviously sick is not worth sticking under. They care more about you doing inventory than they care about the fact that you're spreading your potentially contagious disease(s) to unsuspecting customers? They'll have fewer customers next week if half of the people who touched the items you stocked get sick. Also, learn to hold your ground and not be a doormat. If you can't come in, then you can't come in. Point blank. That goes for working on days you're sick, days you're scheduled to be off but they call you anyway, etc. They can ask you to come in or to cover someone, but you don't have to oblige.

2342,How do you know if you’ve been put on a PIP?,"hey mate, I read your other post, so I'll reply here.

I don't know what you sell, but I can give you some tips for selling anything. 

Basically the first thing you want to do is identify what level of investment your customer/client is making in purchasing goods and/or services from you.

Basically, there are a zillion combinations of product/service, but you can boil almost anything down to a fundamental relationship that is this: all sales fall somewhere along the line connecting two extremes, the extremes are:

1. Low price point, service means nothing since the item is likely consumable and you'll never have to see the retailers ugly mug again

2. Extremely high pricepoint, where you're purchasing a high end product that is irrevocably paired with strenuous, rigorous service - and, by buying this product or service you are tied into a relationship with the seller. (Examples might be hiring a specialized consultant to build a model of a highly complex system, or hiring a lawyer, or purchasing a fleet of Boeing 747's) - in all these cases, you're going to be locked into a relationship for some period of time, sometimes your whole life.

The point here, is that as the seller you need to be cognoscente of the investment the consumer must make in the purchase of your product. If you are selling paper - are you *just* selling paper, or are you selling the service agreement in which you will provide them with paper for a period of time?

If you are selling something relatively inexpensive, your focus should not be on YOU, the focus should be on the product, and economy. If you are selling something more expensive, then you must start to sell yourself as a reliable provider, as well as the product.

In a project management course I took recently, there is a ""goal"" of becoming a ""trusted advisor"". This means that you speak to your client with truth - not sales; but truth. Meaning, that you aren't acting solely to benefit your pocket, or your company's revenue, but you are speaking to them with their best interests at heart. And by doing this, you gain significant good will. Sometimes this comes cheaply, and sometimes it comes at significant expense.

Here are two examples: A client approaches me and asks me to compare and contrast the model we built and the model they had from a couple years ago. I realise immediately that their previous model was built in a very robust way, and contains several tertiary level calculations that I know my junior engineers could not possibly  do. I tell my client that the previous work is at a standard that surpasses the work I have just provided him. He agrees, but then instead of getting mad, he asks what I can do to remediate the situation. I say we can use the client's previous model as a basis for improvement and we adopt some specific modules to the higher standard. We cover the work under training, since I know my junior engineers will learn something valuable. The client is extremely happy and as a result we are awarded with more work.

Example 2: I submit a proposal for some work and the client is considering two different software types to accomplish the job. We are specialised in only one of them. We realise quickly that the training time on the othr software would make our bid uncompetitive. I tell the client that we are not in a position to make a bid on the work because of this issue. They appreciate our position and award the project to someone else. Here, we've been honest up front and the client appreciated our forthcoming attitude and honesty. We lost $150k worth of work, but we gained credibility.

In either case, it's the cost of doing business, but by gaining good will and credibility we're putting ourselves continually in a better position.

The TL;DR here, is that you can find ways to be honest with the client, be honest about everything and it'll pay off. a 10% increase in sales will not be difficult with a bit of time spent getting to know your clients, or knowing what to focus on.

Ohya, and I wouldn't be worried about getting the axe. Don't stress that - that's just paying interest on a debt you haven't incurred. "

We all push ourselves very hard and you're likely a high achiever, but that brings with it stress. The best advice I can give you is that even if everything goes wrong and you lose your job, there is still happiness elsewhere in life.  I'd also suggest seeking professional help through counseling to help overcome these issues. This stuff is easier to fix now than later in life when it gets worse. Believe me, you aren't the only one going through it, particularly when you work so hard to get things done. One of the biggest problems I see brewing in the future of work for those of us under 35 is burnout and fatigue. If you've been formally educated and put your finances on the line to get a good career, then you're going to feel stress that it may go wrong at any moment. And it can and will go wrong. There may be a day you walk in and it's your last day. Trust me when I tell you that day may actually be a blessing and you can find something else that will satisfy you more than your current work.

All this to say OP, don't let work define you as much. Seek some professional counseling. Know that there is life beyond your job and job title. "
2347,"(US) New manager made multiple inappropriate comments regarding my health, and misc. other things. How should I proceed? [xpost from askHR]",When did you go to HR to get an accommodation plan approved originally?

2349,How to deal with a Negative Coworker???,"Hi! I've been where you're at before and have successfully turned that kind of relationship around! Girls like that can kind of suck the life out of you sometimes :( One day I decided I had enough of my co-worker's snobby, narcissistic and controlling personality--and I wasn't going to let this woman-child walk all over me. So, brace yourself, but you have to talk this out with her. Chances are she's not the kind of person who's been called out before, so this is just as good for you as it is for her!

&#x200B;

Definitely don't start with an ""I think you're a toxic person"" opener because then she'll know that you've been hating on her for a really long time; I would assume she would act out (get passive aggressive or snobby) just because no one likes getting called out; it's a defense mechanism. Instead, pick an isolated incident--like if she ever puts you down by saying ""Ew, don't wear that"" then, I'd recommend in the next 10 minutes to an hour, that you ask to speak with her away from everyone else so you can tell her that you don't appreciate it when she says flippant comments like that. Maybe one of these lines would work for you: ""Hey, can I ask you something?"" or ""Let's go get a coffee"" or ""Let me put time on my calendar so we can chat. When are you free?"" Anything neutral like that to get her away if you work in a group so she doesn't feel like she's being called out unprofessionally. Once you have that down--ease into it and say something like: ""Hey, when you said/did *that*, it made me feel really shitty/disrespected and I want to make sure this stops"" or ""Maybe you didn't pick up on it, but when you do or say *that*, it's really unprofessional and I'd rather you kept it to yourself"" Sandwich it with something like ""I really like how you're such a hard worker and you show initiative in the office"" or ""I like your style and would love to hit you up for advice sometime"" --Something that is positive and that shows you respect, at least one part, of who she is.

&#x200B;

Remember--Why are you letting her determine how YOU feel? Once you stop putting her needs before yours, you'll see that it's necessary to advocate for yourself. Don't expect an immediate change, but do expect some push back. When I called out my co-worker, I wasn't prepared for her to go into a crying fit and explain to me that she has a lot of stress in her life/lots of father issues and that sometimes she's mean and just doesn't even realize it. Historically, I'm not the type of person to stick up for myself--I've always minimized my feelings in those situations and it honestly felt so good to A) understand why she is how she is and B) to rally for my fucking self. You can do this gently and in a way that is genuine to your attitude and lifestyle. Don't get worked up, don't shout, don't engage. Just state how you feel (show your vulnerability) and it's up to her how she reacts. 

&#x200B;

Another thing to think about is making sure you can dot your i's and cross your t's--she could call you out for ""doing nothing"" so really look at your work performance so she doesn't manipulate this back on you. If she brings that up again, you can say that's something you'll be happy to work on. If she is just actually that awful to work with, you should escalate it to your boss or your HR department **AFTER** you've attempted to fix the situation. They will be happy to cut off the poison on the team if it means keeping good workers.

2) Meditate. I use an app called Calm and it’s guided meditation (because I hate silence) it’s $60/year but I know there are other rates you can do (monthly, one time payment, etc.). There is a meditation series for everything. There is one on mindfulness at work that helps with stress and work ethic. People have a hard time believing that slowing your day down increases productivity. TRUST ME, slowing down your day will help. What I mean by that is take time and do 15 minutes of meditation, slow down the racing thoughts and learn to look at things with a different perspective. In the words of Tom and Donna from Parks and Rec, Treat yo self.” Spend some time learning about yourself and your thoughts. Don’t be afraid to take a breather, the human body tells you when it needs it.

3) Find what you enjoy (easier said than done, right? WRONG) what do you truly enjoy in life? For me, it’s computers and video games. So what I did was I started studying for different certifications to understand computer related items and how video games are made.  Now, your thinking, “But I have no motivation to do it.” The biggest mistake you can make is giving yourself a “made-up” timeline. All this does is create an unrealistic expectation for yourself and frustrate you when you fall behind. Think of it this way, each day is an investment into your future. The fact that you thought about doing certifications tells me all I need to know about you. You are motivated, but maybe you don’t know where to start. One day at a time (as cliche as it sounds) but trust me, thinking so far out in the future will overwhelm you. 

My parting thoughts:

2360,Advice on how to keep a fast food job. My low self esteem has gotten me a warning from my boss,"Is there a list of priorities in terms of what you should be doing? Being new to fast food can be daunting but you'll get the hang of it. Maybe ask tips on how you can improve to not seem like you're having to be told what to do. You have to learn to be quick and efficient as we all know how hectic fast food places can be. You should watch more experienced workers when you have the time and ask questions so you can better your skills. 

it can take a while to be comfortable interacting with patrons but you have to learn to hide it. I'm very shy and anxious but I try to keep that at bay when interacting with patients at my job. I'd take any and all tips from your boss and try to do the best you can. "

3. I suspect you have a lot less right about the details than you think you do, but if if you were 100% correct, it doesn't matter unless someone sues, and this employee's record was so horrendous all you have to do is send the employee file to the attorney to never hear from them again. "
2362,The company won't get rid of this problem employee for some reason - why?,"Did you have a post awhile back about wanting to change workgroups because of her, or are there really two people out there demanding the name Queen?

I worked with someone that was toxic and outright mean for years.  The boss saw someone extremely good at her job because she played it up so much, while the people around her were miserable.  Eventually HR had to get involved and slowly in the background action started getting taken.  Perhaps when they say they've tried to tame her, they've  started the trail of corrective action?   Maybe not enough people are speaking out about it?  That was what caused the delay where I worked.  Everyone was afraid.

Also, make sure you go over anything you don’t understand in a timely manner. The worst thing to do is to let what you don’t understand fall behind of schedule. "

2371,Fired because of 'no call/no show'.,"To be honest, in my industry it's still a bit unacceptable. As a human, I feel for you and can relate and sympathize. I've been there. But I always have and would rather throw up on my bosses shoes, or sneeze in their face than just not show up, unless I'm *literally en route* to the Emergency room. Coming in to work and letting your boss see that you are indeed unfit for work is the way to go. Deciding for yourself is not. 

As a boss, I'm trying to run a business and need as much notice as possible. Being short handed can cost hundreds of dollars in product loss, loss of sales and set back production for the entire day. My entire team gets stressed, my customers have to wait and get shitty service and I had to wake up early to do your job and stay late to finish mine. So yeah, in my industry, it's not acceptable.  "
2372,Why do people call it offered a job?,"It's called ""offer"" because the premise is people aren't entitled to a job. Of course, a job is so you're a productive person in society and you get paid for your line of work. And if it's something you love doing that's an extra plus. But no company is obligated to give you a job even if you really will work your ass off and expressed your passionate interest in the type of work.

Another thing to keep in mind is finding a job that you really want with a company you like is difficult these days. So what you gain is work experience and pay when taking an offer even though it's not work you're interested in or the company is horrible. "
2373,What does it means to do ok or mediocre?,"Every company needs “average” workers. They’re a fixed labor cost, typically don’t change jobs often, and produce. Labor is the biggest cost on every company balance sheet. While it’s nice to have over-performers: that person will typically leave for better opportunities or push for internal advancement. 
 
Poor workers are an expensive anchor, they don’t produce at an acceptable level for the cost. 
 
Mid-level workers keep the company going. Their contribution is net profitable, but isn’t exploited. 
 
Everyone with a boss should have some way to quantify “success” in their position. Whether it’s a metric or some other form of evaluation. Talk about what success means, have regular performance evaluations. "

2377,My Boss criticized my work as Hacking,"I wouldn’t care about what he said but rather what he did (put a stop to it) and why. Perhaps from his point you were doing something only you could do (technically) and that introduces risk to him. Ideally, if you leave he needs to backfill you - so he might prefer you and the rest of the team stick to standardized processes. Even if your way is better - in the big picture it might be worse. For example, if I’m managing a .NET shop I really don’t want one wicked-sharp kid writing a bunch of Java code. I really don’t care if it is x% better according to him.  "

2381,Does working abroad look good on a resume?,"Here in Canada in finance, foreign experience and degrees from outside of the anglosphere are essentially useless. So it would be a disadvantage. "
2382,Is the PMP or Six Sigma right for me?,"while both of these credentials hit their respective heights of relevance years ago, they are still both highly recognized today.

Lean Six Sigma is a bit better than plain SS, since it empowers the entire organization, rather than keeping the magic in the hands of a few statisticians.  Organizations like how it can motivate the masses, and even if only partially adopted it can add significant value. Six Sigma *without the lean* is more of an all or nothing, my way or the highway attidude that only works when senior management is fully onboard.

PMP is the defacto 'gold standard' when it comes to project management credentials. Unlike L6S, is is exclusive and proprietary to the PMI organization (with L6S you have several strong choices for certification).  PMP is a tough exam, and rumour has it that they maintain a 50% failure rate to keep it elite. 

Unfortunately, PMI has double-downed on its emphasis of Agile methologies into it's flagship PMP credential, which may stengthen it in IT circles, but at the same time distance it in relevance to other industries where Agile has not caught on and likely never will, such as Construction, Manufacturing, Supply Chain, Advertising, and Event Planning.

Unfortunately, nothing has emerged to challenge PMP dominance in the PM certification space...

So, are you are looking for a credential for immediate impact, PMP will do the trick - but there is a growing dissatisfaction in what it represents... so, tomorrow - who knows.

As L6S has grown in popularity within Supply Chain, Manufacturing, Health Care, it has lost favor in IT and technology integration... 

So for YOU, what industry are you looking to focus, and in what timeframe are you looking for the credential to be meangful? "
2383,Where to start in underwriting,"I am in mortgage industry and so far have seen three underwriters that came and go. All had basic business degree that they earned forever ago and had no other formal underwriting experiences/training prior getting the job. However, two of them (including our current underwrites) were loan officers before were promoted to underwriting position....and before they became loan officers they were mortgage processors. Mortgage underwriter is a position that is definitely trainable. One of our current underwriters has no college degree...just a HS diploma. "
2384,What sort of Writing Samples should I curate?,"I was previously in lifestyle editorial. For my portfolio (which I hosted on journoportfolio - really easy to use btw), I had:

-Academic essay specializing in history of art (was my MA degree)
-Travel article I had written during a previous internship
-Roundup of favourite beauty products (for an application to a beauty publication - it was never published) 
-Interview I had conducted as part of a work experience programme

Personally I had a lot of samples from various internships, but if you don't have any, don't be afraid to add your guest blog posts or a written sample from your law days (any technical content you created for them might help!). Of course if your guest blog posts match up if the interests of the companies you're applying for, that's even better. 

I think what really stands out is to make sure your writing samples are technically sound and you at least have a good vocabulary. At a higher level, some places might want you to have a distinct voice (either for the company or yourself) to make your work stand out, but I wouldn't say too worry too much about that at the start. 

Good luck! "
2385,Call center experience,"Depends on the call center and the types of call you will be handling.

My first role was as a debt collector for a credit card company. It taught me the usual, customer and case handling, some basic IT skills etc. The big advantage it gave though was that it was a role with a company I wanted to work for and so I could take advantage of the general preference for internal over external hirrs.

For some careers, retail banking, IT support work etc it is THE entry level job for the industry. For other jobs its your way into the company at the ground floor. Those are the two main benefits if you re looking to further your career. "
2386,Hiring someone with a disability?,"I work for the federal government and it does a pretty good job accommodating people with disabilities. I've managed a few people with special needs and I just take their abilities in stride. I would never tell someone with a disability that a job isn't right for them unless their disability made them unsafe or totally unable to do the job with reasonable accommodations. I would try to coach anyone into finding a way to do the best job they can. The concept of time is money isn't as much a factor in government employment :)

2389,"My friend had the experience for the job, but got passed up because he had the wrong bachelors degree? Is this common?",Yes it’s common. This is especially common if the application process has screening software involved as the program will automatically weed out anyone who doesn’t have the key words in their application. The only way I can think of that could maybe circumvent this is through a referral. 
2390,Helpdesk to Technical Support,"A degree and certifications will be helpful to stand out among other applicants, but they aren't entirely necessary. Even if you just do a couple classes on Udemy, that should be a good way to get your foot in the door. "

2392,When's the best time to add a skill to your resume?,[removed] 
2393,Does QA testing require a degree now?,It depends entirely on the employment situation. I am currently doing QA on the code I wrote. It's a small company so we all wear many hats. 
2394,Does a decent personal blog count as experience to marketing hiring managers?,"Are you me?? God, this is so similar to my situation, even down to the niche sports blog thing, except I'm not fortunate enough to be currently working as a writer of any sort (stuck in a dead-end administrative/sales position - yuck). Honestly I would kill for a job in technical writing.

I don't know if this is right, but it's what I'm doing: put all of your creative projects/portfolios at the top of your resume with hyperlinks to your work and leave off any irrelevant jobs you might have held unless it's your only paid work experience. I've been applying thinking you have to put paid work experience first, but I'm beginning to realize that if you don't have relevant experience (personal projects ARE experience) on the top third of your resume, hiring managers send you straight to the reject pile without so much as glancing at anything on the bottom 2/3 of the resume or looking at additional writing samples/portfolios you might send with your application. (Seriously, HR people seem to be the laziest, most clueless people I've ever had to deal with; you basically have to spell out everything for them on your resume like they're 3 years old. They want their jobs to be easy, so make it easy for them by front-loading the crap out of your resume with work examples.)

I think in this industry, demonstrating that you can write creative content is perhaps the most important thing. It shows employers what skill set you already possess and what you're capable of. I can't tell you what marketing managers might be looking for, but in my experience looking at job postings, most of them want at a bare minimum demonstrated proficiency with WordPress, AP style (or occasionally Chicago style), professional-looking photographs, some familiarity with HTML and CSS, and most of them also want to see that you have experience managing social media pages for a company (in this situation I've simply made social media pages to correspond with my blog). Upper-entry level positions might want anything from video editing experience, web design experience, graphic design experience, and/or require you to be an ""expert"" with certain software like Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, or Photoshop. Startups and small to mid-sized companies seem to have more relaxed experience requirements; large companies usually seem to want everything I mentioned above for the most basic entry-level positions, plus administrative, HR, and data analysis experience and a bunch of other random stuff on the side.

Edited to add - I don't know how much companies care about blog views, but I think it would only help you. I only get a few dozen views per blog post on mine, but then again I'm writing about a recreational ice hockey league in an area that doesn't give a crap about ice hockey. I think it's probably more important that you show you can do the work, and the work speaks for itself. "
2395,Getting a job in HR with a strategic communications degree,"To be a recruiter, you don’t need an HR degree! 

If you’d like to explore more of HR - join your local SHRM chapter. Attend meetings, read the newsletter. HR is such an interesting industry because we can do everything from benefits to safety to compensation, training and development, recruiting, employee relations, strategic planning. 

If you find you want to go more traditional HR after recruiting, look for HR admin or HR assistant jobs. study for your PHR or SHRM-CP. Pass the certification exam. There’s a lot of room to specialize or be a Generalist in the HR world! 

Good luck! "
2396,"Why ""Attending Non-University Certificate or Diploma"" is a requirement?","I’m late in replying but I’m currently in a community college (non-university) diploma program studying to be a tech in a niche field. The reason why people ask for these particular diploma holders, no more, no less, is two fold. One is that as diploma holders we are simply cheaper to pay than degree holders. The second being that we actually come out with a lot more skills than a degree holder would in that field as we are taught the skills relevant to the field right away, instead of focusing on the theories/research related to the field as universities often teach. 

That’s the evidence that I’ve gleaned from working in my field so far. "

I’ve been working in construction 10 years now (over in the UK), first as a quantity surveyor and now as a project manager. I still feel like a fish out of water at times and struggle with the demands. Unfortunately this industry is very unforgiving and falls down badly on adequate training for fresh graduates and experienced hires alike. The undergraduate degrees don’t prepare you for the real world and many companies are not prepared to invest in tailored graduate schemes.

I’ve learnt through a combination of trial and error and luck. In the process, I’ve been through 6 jobs and can say it’s been mixed. Some companies have been awful toxic environments and I’ve left after 6 months, while my last company was bearable so I ended up staying 3 years.

My advice is to accept you won’t know everything and just do what you can. Don’t let people walk on you - speaking from experience the industry is full of bullies who prey on the weak.
If you want to avoid another toxic workplace, you may want to explore opportunities with larger consultancies with well established systems and HR protocol where It’s less likely a sociopathic manager will get away with bullying and harassment.

From a personal perspective, I don’t know if I want to stay in the industry much longer but have always struggled to establish what else I’d like to do instead. So for now, I’ll continue to plod along and do my best. "

2419,What are marketable skills or courses?,Market and social research: https://www.georgiacenter.uga.edu/courses/market-research/principles-of-market-research 
2420,Am I going down the right path?,"So, most entry level marketing jobs don't require a degree. Simply because, a marketing degree teaches you about running a business and how to form a strategy. The degree teaches you to be a CMO and rarely touches on growing an organic audience on social media.

Certificates are great, but most companies offer internships towards people pursuing a degree. I don't want to discourage you, but I don't think I've worked with a marketing intern who wasn't in the middle of an undergrad program. What determines who gets the internship? Connections. If you want an internship use your network/parents network/friends and ask for help. Once you get the interview you can use your certs to stand out. "
2421,I want to be a college admission officer but don't have degrees in education or mass communication,"I'm going to answer all of your questions and then some:

The career field you want to enter is called ""student affairs."" In addition to admissions, it comprises all student services: housing, counseling, conduct, Greek life, and so on.

Virtually all jobs in student affairs are master's-required. If you want to have a chance, you will need to get a specific student affairs master's degree. Unfortunately, your food science master's degree will not help you one bit in this field.

Luckily, most master's programs in student affairs will accept students from any background - as long as you can articulate on your application that you are passionate about helping college students, you'll be golden. People who work in higher ed come from all kinds of backgrounds. It's an extemely diverse field, and prides itself on being so diverse.

A few warnings: it's a very competitive field. You'll probably spend a few years while in grad school overworked and underpaid as an ""intern"" (even though your responsibilities and hours will be comparable to a professional), and then still might to struggle to get a job after all the effort. 

In addition, I hope you aren't attached to where you live, because it will be expected that you do a national job search after graduating. If you are selective about which colleges you apply to for full-time work, you will just be holding yourself back. Take whatever you can get, anywhere in the country. Some people end up working at the same college where they got their master's, or in the same area, or at the college in the next town over - but many people do not - so be open to traveling. Furthermore, promotions are rare, so once you have learned all you need to from a job, be ready to move across the country yet again to take on a higher-level position.

If that kind of workload, and those warnings, don't bother you, then absolutely go for it.

And if you want to know more, go to your current school's career services office and make an appointment. I can almost guarantee you that every career counselor went through a student affairs master's program, and they can tell you what the career field is like.

One last thing: the student affairs field is made up of so many people that you'll really have to come to your own conclusions. I'm trying to be a realist here, but some people will say it's only positive and fun, some will say you don't actually need a master's, and some people are extremely toxic. Everyone who works in student affairs has a different perspective about it. 

Sorry not sorry for the long answer. Consider yourself informed.

Sincerely,
Someone who had worked in student affairs for 6 years, in 3 states, at 4 colleges. "
2422,Need advice getting back into computer science field,"You should do both personal coding projects to add to your portfolio and applications simultaneously, although realistically it will be a lot easier and faster to do the first because you can start on that immediately whereas you may not be ready for an entry-level position right away. It may be difficult to find an internship after 4 years out from your degree. "

2424,"51 job applications for Raytheon, still no call.",Raytheon is a huge and prestigious company and they receive 10’s of thousands of resumes a year. Sometimes they just fill their positions before they’re done reading the resumes of their applicants. There’s a lot of very qualified people they don’t give the time of day to. Don’t be too hard on yourself. Apply to other companies and see what else is out there. 
2425,Hard finding entry-level jobs with current work history.,"Some things that come to mind are:

* Research what are the starting position (entry level) job in the field you want to enter, and find the job titles. Then search for those titles and apply to the jobs that require no or very little experience. 
* People are always talking about professional organizations or networking events. I don't know how to get into these but its an idea. 
* Try to connect with recruiters or managers in the field. 

It seems like you can't really enter a new field these days, because the market is so oversaturated with qualified, experienced candidates that they won't consider a new person. If you know somebody who can vouch for you that seems to be practically the only way to get 90% of jobs. They often have hundreds of candidates for these entry level jobs (just saw one posted 4 days ago with over 700 applications). I think they are literally taking people with Masters and 10 years of experience and paying them $18 at an ""entry level"" position. That's how bad it seems to be now, especially lately with COVID-19. "
2426,New job but grossly underemployed,"Add on.They knew my experience during my interview and said it would be extremely useful, knowing my passion was in negotiation and client relations. Currently I do neither of these. I was also told they were absorbed from another agency that is well known, I unfortunately filled in the blanks in the interview and they told me it was the company i was was thinking of. This was not true they were a part of a different company. "
2427,"When interviewing for an administrative assistant position in a law firm, how much do they expect me to know?","Being an admin assistant is like being a retail store employee; It's a low-skilled job, and anything you need to know will be explained during the job.

They're looking for culture fit and reliability rather than seeing if you know how to book plane tickets. Good luck in the interview! "
2428,How do you read USA federal pay scales?,"I work for the feds and have been involved with a lot of hiring. At least at my office there are very specific standards. I've also applied for other jobs in different agencies and they had the same rules. A four year degree from an accredited institution with a 3.0 or above GPA qualifies for a GS7 STEP1. HR can evaluate full time work experience in the field as well, but 1 year usually doesn't mean much. What we can do is usually ask for a candidates last two pay stubs and try to match the step just above what they are currently making (if it's a relevant field). That is up to the hiring persons discretion though. A masters qualifies for a GS9, doctorate GS11. Keep in mind the job catagory has to actually have those GS levels. "
2429,Would you put a course which has no degree on your curriculum?,"In general, I think MOOC's and other non-recognised qualifications can potentially be a talking point - to show that you have interest in a subject area and have actively developed that interest - but don't expect anyone to consider that it increases your employability in and of itself. If it is relevant and you can work it into a cover letter, great. Probably not worth putting on the CV without further context.

Also as someone else has said, the course title seems a little nebulous. Logical and critical thinking is useful in all aspects of life, but would you be able explain how what you've learnt on the course directly relates to the jobs you've applied for? With examples?

I applaud you for seeking out things to do with your time. I myself have devolved into a slob since the lockdown. Still, without any further information I don't think this course sounds like it will help you with finding employment. "

I’ve got a Masters Degree and I feel like I’ve pretty much been tested to death already. What is everyones thoughts on these?

Having a Master’s degree is no guarantee that you will get your dream job. As annoying as they seem to be (they are even available in lower income jobs), I’d do them nevertheless. The main point is to send out as many as you can; there’s bound to be one who will accept you.

Furthermore the crew can be the people you wouldn't want to spend time with outside of work. You'll be miserable for the whole season with little to no sleep and won't make much starting out. As contracts go, the season ends when the fish is no longer to be caught so it all depends. If you want to try with a big company like United states seafood or o hara start off as a Processor then try to work your way up. I would never go that route since its 16 hours a day for 90 days out in the middle of nowhere. "
2438,An Entry Level Job with 5+ Years Experience,"If you don't know technology then you should probably pursue some type of programming.  Automation is going to make the job market worse for those on the ""bottom"".  I don't know what to say really but many people will be devastated once they see robots building houses in the next five years.  i.e. the self-driving car problem has been solved for almost five years now.  There just wasn't an infrastructure to support the release of that tech, but now with all of the clouds available, the distributed system implementation can be maintained quite easily and cheaply.  It is not an economic decline but people will call it that; however, it will be a market made for people who can solve problems and build helpful tools.  Seriously https://freecodecamp.org  It would take literally 6 months to turn around anyone's future but most people in the millennial generation don't want to work hard to get out of the funk of being handed money.

The current generation regurgitates information and very few of them can think outside of the box.  Databases, networking, programming, literally any technology that you can get your hands on.

2447,"Phone Interview Monday. How can I make a case of my work experience, even though I was fired from my last job?","You could still speak to the experience you mentioned, you just need to find a context that works.  It's very common for people to do things outside of their job description, but that means for professional experience there's a risk of corroboration.  Qualifying the experience as volunteer or entrepreneurial somehow is worth considering. "
2448,How to move up at my job,
2449,How lax are public sector jobs about qualifications?,"Many public sector jobs are far more strict about requirements, prerequisites, experience, etc - mainly due to litigation concerns. "
2450,"Foreign high-school diploma but US degree, do I need to take the GED?","I think the problem isn't actually that you need a US high school diploma, but that when you apply for a job that only requires this and you have a BS and an MS, the people who see your application can't figure out why someone with so much education would want this job or they don't want to hire someone who might surpass them one day. 

Get your GED and take the college off of your resume. "
2451,"I have been a professional sign language interpreter for ten years, can I get an entry level administrative assistant position in the small community where I live?","I'm sure you have transferable skills. Go for the job! 

I imagine as a sign language interpreter, you have good communication skills, are good with nuances, work well with people (teams). Interpreting sign language *is* a form of multi-tasking, right? You have to take in what you hear, and give it back out as sign language. Your skill is a form of customer service, and a communication skill. It's also an asset that you can communicate with deaf people. 

Being competent in another language (sign language is another language), also shows you're a good learner (it's something you have to actively learn), so if you're not familiar with something, you'll work to pick it up.

I'd say you're a good fit. :) "
2452,7 years in marketing with very little mentorship,"If you remove them from your resume, you'll likely have a break in employment history that won't be in your favor.  Prepare your resume as solidly and truthfully as you can and confidently state what you do know during your interview.  Also, tell an interviewer how you're interested in further developing the skills and foundation you have.  Sometimes employers want experts and sometimes they want someone who knows enough to be shaped and is willing to fit in their environment/culture.  Look for jobs with the same or fewer years of experience, it cannot hurt to broaden your search.  Good Luck and don't sell yourself short. "
2453,"Moving to the US soon, what to do?","Are you authorized to work in the US, or will you be requiring sponsorship? "
2454,Question about Major Gifts Officer job,"I worked in a university advancement (fundraising) office for a while, and a major gifts officer is the person who handles people who have been identified as possible major donors and have the potential to give very large gifts toward a particular program or complex of programs.   This is usually a very experienced development officer (fundraiser), who is good at identifying the donors' interests and giving capacity and finds a way to connect it to a major funding opportunity.  

It's a long process -- up to a couple of years, in part because tax issues are often involved -- and it is essentially a weird form of sales. What you are selling is the satisfaction of doing good to a rich person who's got money to spare and maybe wants to be remembered for more in life than building a lot of luxury apartment buildings.  

One of our old major donors just passed; he was a former engineer turned real estate developer, and his donations alone laid the foundation for a real engineering division at our otherwise liberal-arts-heavy university.  It of course has his name on it.

Development officers are often ""guns for hire"" who drift from university to university; but some of them come up from the ranks of university administration -- usually by getting involved with fundraising for whatever department or program they work for -- and go from there. 

I would actually encourage you to look at university employment.  I don't know what ""macro"" social work is, but the university I work for has actual social workers on staff, a variety of student assistance prorams, a food program, a ""student success"" program, advising positions of various types beyond simple academic advising, and more.  A good-sized university is really a small city with a very specialized set of welfare and social service programs. "
2455,Becoming a teacher in UK?,Which country in the UK? They have different systems. 
2456,Should I bother applying to a job if I have the qualifications but not the degree?,"I wouldn't bother applying. Yet, I know many people who end up applying and that's why employers have 100s of people applying but yet really only 10 qualify for an interview. It makes it harder for other people trying to get the job because they have to wait for the applications that didn't qualify to be screened. It also depersonalizes the hiring process and that's why you have the cookie cutter assessment tests and exams. "
2457,Marketing communications position without knowledge of Illustrator?,"Hey there,

As someone in this industry who has a job like the one you’re looking for; I’d recommend doing a certified course on the Abobe Creative Suite, especially Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign. Those are the three key programs you’ll be using.

It may be disheartening to hear, but these programs take a while to learn as they are very in depth, so the company you’re applying to ~may not have the time to train you in such a large program in the timeframe they need you to know it by. Many companies already have premade templates they use for EDMs, Banners, Social Media, Packaging etc. created through Adobe and you’ll need to know how to work with that. 

I really hope this doesn’t demotivate you and wish you all the very best, but do strongly suggest on upskilling in proper Graphics Design software before applying for these types of roles as you competitors would have already done so as well.

Once again, best of luck! "
2458,"How normal is it to say ""I'm afraid you may not want this job as you are over-qualified"" ?","Also, it's hard to fit in with your co workers, since your background is totally different then theres. You probably dont have much in common with most of them, so you'll be less likely to stay in the long run. "
2459,"""Pursuing a degree"" in advertised requirements",It depends on how they want to handle compensation. Some places deliberately seek interns because they can pay them in college credit (no $$). Any place like that would not consider you because you'd require an actual wage. 
2460,I'd prefer to leave by job and work elsewhere in Accounting since it's what I taught myself but I don't feel my knowledge is legit nor do I feel educationally qualified.,"Make your resume very good. It sounds like you can list a lot of different duties and job titles on your resume. As for the education, I would just leave it off. A lot of ppl don't even put their high school on their resume "
2461,Am I qualified for this position?,"Your experience and current work don’t seem to qualify you for the role based on their posting details. However, I don’t know what your degree has exposed you to. Majority of Project Managers that I know got started with a Project Engineer role (more technically involved rather than being in charge of the big picture) or as an associate/junior level role in Project Management. Most companies like to see proven experience in the direct field or, at the very least, in general which would give you transferable skills (e.g. Lean Six, PMP, lifecycle experience, etc).  
  
So while it never hurts to take a shot and apply, you should definitely be self-aware of your short-comings in relation to their preferred qualifications and requirements. This will help you plan what you need to learn and gain experience in, as well as allow you to give them an honest answer as to how you can be an asset to them. Knowing your weaknesses and having a plan to progress and improve is sometimes equally as beneficial to a company as someone with the skill set from the get-go. "
2462,How do I make up for a lack of relevant work experience when applying to jobs?,Emphasize how your skills line up with their requirements. You can also discuss the experiences your school projects gave you. 
2463,What sort of math test will this job administer for screening?,"My guess is basic algebra at most unless the job actually requires something more advanced.

Like can you convert units etc. is probably all they need. "
2464,Jobs that say “require an associates”?,Yup - minimum is an associates. You have a higher level degree. 
2465,I'm overqualified and I have questions regarding omitting my master's degree from my resume. How should I reframe my work experience?,"Vaguely related, but I have an Mba and just recently took a job that probably doesn’t require a college degree, as a shift supervisor at a truck repair facility. I left my resume as is. Talked about my relevant experience and we didn’t discuss my Mba. "
2466,"This may be a student question, but what are the best qualities of an administrative assistant?",Multi tasking = able to switch priorities at a moments notice 
2467,How to prove for my employeer my knowledge in a tool without previous professional experience?,"You probably can just add it in 'Skills' and most people will believe it. If it's a critical skill for a role they will interview you on it, no one is going to review your Github. 

If you want to add some emphasis on it, create a projects section and then list a few cool things you did with VBA in words, not code. Talk about it in concrete terms on how you recognize potential business impact - ""saved x hours"", ""automated 3m rows"", etc. "

2474,Am I able to work at a car dealership + what would the benefits be?,"you would probably get a discount, but most dealerships only hire 21 plus with a valid drivers license and sales experience. you can start applying at 18 but you would still need the drivers license and sales experience. my best bet is to start somewhere else in sales. tmobile, kiosk at the mall, anywhere you make commision, it will build your skills in sales to which you could transfer over to a dealership which is BIG money if you know how to sell. "
2475,"Should I spend nearly $5k to obtain certifications in an industry I am not yet in, but want to get into?","Nope, I would just keep going with the interviews and not worry about the certs. These companies wouldn't interview you just for fun. They see something that intrigues them in your skills. The fact you are getting the interviews is encouraging and you will get better each time.  

Eventually one will stick that will work for you (a local position) and then you're golden.  You'll get there. "
2476,Most Important Skills for a Patient Services Rep?,Spanish 
2477,Industry experience > academia experience?,Pretty much. No one gets a job straight out of college out there. If they do it's because they've got contacts or the timing was right. And by that I mean the company was desperate or no one else had applied. 
2478,Is it possible to get a job if unqualified by working for a low salary until you can prove your competence,"I’m not sure about the temp and/or small business world in Sweden but I did a similar thing in the US. Many smaller places won’t be hiring for the position you want to be in but will be willing to add those tasks to your role if you show some skills. The trade off is you learn them without the pay but since you are willing to sacrifice that from the start you seem to be on board with that.

So I got hired as a purchasing contractor (basically buy supplies for office/manufacturing). The guy hiring me was new and looking for someone with more Excel skills but the company wouldn’t open a position for that need. So he hired me under that generic role and used me as a analyst in training (he directed the metrics he wanted and I made it happen in Excel). I eventually picked up programming on the job and left with some experience and a good reference. That led to an IT contract at a Fortune 500.

It is possible, but having been through it get some sort of education, especially since you have a picture of what you want. I found success in the contract world but was unable to convert to full-time dev until I got the degree. "
2479,What to do when you feel under qualified for new job?,"You're new - your start learning quick.

They realized you dont know everything? You keep learning.

By the time they want to take any kind of action you'll already have learned enough of the job and improved enough that it wont be worth it for them to do anything.

So basically, just spend your time at work learning the stuff you dont know how to do and getting paid for it. "
2480,"Biochemistry and nothing but serving experience, what career to start?","I've never served anyone in my life, but I'm helping my friend through something like this now. I highly advise your friend to take a break from serving first of all since it's a stressful job and it's hard to concentrate on other things when you have that job. Second of all, she should go into some chem./biotech workshops, get as many certificates as she can, and take some short community college/university classes relevant to biochem. or analytical chemistry. She should keep in constant contact with the instructors so that they can help her as much as possible. The courses can be online or just short workshops but they're important as a ""reset"" in her career. She should keep that server experience in her resume to show what she did for the last 3 years and then also show the certificates/classes/workshops she took afterwards. Most employers I know in this industry assume that anyone who just has a degree and no relevant job experience needs to be fully trained so your friend should be mostly on par with other freshly-graduated candidates. She should ask the instructors she developed good connections with to go over her resume and forward her any entry level jobs they might know of. 

Then she should apply for some entry-level positions in her field of study (Craigslist often has a bunch). These are mostly low-level technician jobs where people just follow established guidelines (mostly preparing solutions, cleaning glassware, ordering lab supplies, doing basic assays), but that doesn't matter so long as it's slightly relevant to her career. Analytical chemistry is actually pretty good for people who just have a B.S. degree in chemistry/biology and you can easily get on-the-job training and grow your skillset. No matter where her first job is though, she should constantly ask to learn more stuff and connect with as many people as she can. The first relevant job is absolutely the hardest to get in anyone's biochem. career but afterwards she'll become much more valuable and remember the days when she was just a server.

Her opportunities however are limited to her location though. It's much easier to get your foot in the door if you're in an urban biotech [hotspot](https://www.biospace.com/hotbeds), but if she's single, has no kids/ties to her location, I highly advise her moving to her first job for a couple of years until she has experience and then move to where she wants. Let me know if you have any more questions! My friend I'm advising is content with her ""serving"" job even though she has a B.S. in biology and I don't want that to happen to anyone else. "
2481,"I keep finding job ads that call the position ""entry level"", yet when you look at the description the job duties are clearly not.","There is no such thing as an ""entry level"" *job*. What you're seeing are jobs that are ""entry level"" to the *company.* It is now universally required for all job applicants to already hold some level of experience in their field, be it an internship, part-time work, volunteering, etc. Companies are no longer providing any training for their employees.  "
2482,"Math Major Recently Graduated, Should I get an online MBA or an online MS in Analytics?","Neither. Online MBA is worthless, and unless you plan on doing a lateral career change into a Data Analyst role, MS in Analytics won't do you much good. 

Do your FA job for 2 years, then look into part-time/full-time MBA programs that are top 10-20 level. If you find out you're not a fan of the business side and want something more math/tech heavy, look into MS for Data Science programs at top 5 schools. "

Should I be fully transparent when I send my email/resume?,"I got laid off a couple months ago, you might find this relatable [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5hvB3A1ZM4&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5hvB3A1ZM4&t=1s) "
2495,Data entry/Lockbox job at a bank: What's it like?,Have you applied? Those jobs typically want prior cashier/teller experience. 
2496,Applying for jobs that require an Interim Secret or Top Secret Clearance,"I've looked into it myself, and you can't really get a security clearance of any sort on your own. A company has to sponsor you for it and pay the rather hefty fees. Gets to be kind of a catch-22, since to get a security clearance you need a job that requires one, but to get a job that requires one, you need to already have one. "
2497,What do I do when I have way more experience than my very bossy boss?,"I think you hit the nail on the head - you are going from being your own boss to answering to someone else. None of this has to be stressful - it isn’t on you if he chooses to use the wrong chemical or to charge too little. That’s his reputation and profit, not yours. If he works in a frenzy and wants to take over so you can start the next section, let it go. Your pay doesn’t change based on what part of the job you are doing, so you are ticking seconds off your life stressing about something that doesn’t matter. 

Try to let this go. Use the opportunity to adjust to working with difficult personalities as you will surely encounter them at your next job. "
2498,My brother is good at chess and games. What job could suit his skills?,Computer jobs are perfect for introverts. 
2499,I don’t know what jobs I qualify for or my worth.,"You just apply and see what sticks.  Let the businesses be the one to tell you that your credentials don't stack up.  Meanwhile, it's important to understand that jobs with incredibly clear, concise, and objective statements about the work you will do tend to be ones that don't pay particularly well because the company has managed to make it some optimized assembly line job that any warm body with a relevant degree can complete.  The better paying jobs are the ones that exist a bit more in the abstract where you do have certain key responsibilities and tasks, but the final form the job ultimately takes is likely to be colored by your specific priorities and skill set.  In this way, it's important to step back and look at the listing from the perspective of ""How would I go about addressing the responsibilities of this job?"" with the answer depending on how you do things.  Are you a manager-type who makes use of outside input and consulting from your network to meet a business need?  Are you a programmer-type who tends to automate processes every chance you get?  Are you a science-type who will come in and try to develop models for production to improve efficiency?  And, so on. "
2500,Is my salary low balled?,You have no experience and they are going to pay to train you. It’s basically a paid internship and a good rate of pay considering. 
2501,Self taught in computer repair/hardware what jobs could I be qualified for,IT help desk.

2506,How hard is it to learn basic Excel?,Not hard at all. It's just boring. 
2507,Warehouse Picking Strategies,"Stretch before starting. It’s so easy to hurt your back if you don’t warm up, especially when you’re doing physical warehouse work. I strained mine at 21 when I didn’t even know you could have a back injury that young lol, now I always spend 5-10 min warming up. "
2508,"Can your job title say ""engineer"" if you are not a certified engineer (not recognized by the state / country)?",Your resume should use the title the company gave you. It is up to them to decide what to call you. 
2509,Does your degree really matter?,"Absolutely it matters. As an engineer, nearly all of the jobs I qualify for require an engineering degree, and some even require a specific type of engineering. Same goes for other disciplines as well, but this is most common in STEM. I imagine there are certain positions where multiple degrees will be acceptable, but yes degree matters in the grand scheme of things, but there are exceptions. "

Now some jobs do require licensing but that is a different conversation.  You either have the license or certification or you don't. "

2521,Why do companies even bother hiring an “unproven worker”?,"Few people are hiring baby eggs and investing. That's why people with jobs have an easier time getting hired, job tenures are shortening, and there are major skills gaps in the workforce. "
2522,Retail Sales associate looking for Server Jobs. Any tips?,You have customer service experience therefore you can add that to your resume 
2523,What's the most ridiculous requirement that you've ever seen for an entry level position?,I saw an entry-level position $15/hr in my field that I was going to apply to until I read that it had a PhD as a hard requirement. I about spat out my coffee. 
2524,Accounting at John Deere,
2525,A Question Regarding Education Level On An Application,"Doubt it would be an issue. If it were me I'd be excited that someone young had that level of motivation. To me, it'd imply a good work ethic given the constraint of your age

I certainly see nothing negative from it "
2526,Who here has coordinated a desk move in a company?,"I did it as an admin assistant. Moved 50+ people more than once. Hardest part was getting people to be ready by the deadline. 

Spreadsheets, constant communication and being authoritative helped. "
2527,Any thoughts on what my job title should be?,What is your career goal? I think you should pick something that best align with the career goal you have in mind. Do you want to work closer with developers on the technical side or do you prefer working with customer? 
2528,High School Diploma Qualifications,"Hi there! Retail is definitely a career that traps you really fast, but the transferable skills look good on a resume. 

The best thing to do is apply for jobs even if you don’t hit all of the qualifications. I transferred from retail to being a paralegal at a law firm (I think I only hit 3/5 qualifications they asked for and don’t have a degree). 

Good luck! "
2529,"Generally, how much weight do preferred qualifications hold?",Some places would prefer education and credentials to experience; some places prefer experience. Unfortunately there’s not usually a way to know unless you apply. So apply! Good luck 
2530,Skills for advertising and marketing jobs.,"Lol. I guess the skills that you’re currently learning in your program?

I would just look at job postings for these kinds of roles to get a sense of what they’re looking for. "

2533,Can you tell me what it's like to work as a receptionist?,Edit: this would be at a book distributor 
2534,How long should one be in a professional field before teaching as a professor?,"You won't know unless you apply. Local community colleges can be pretty hard up for teachers for these courses, or they could be slammed with applicants trying to get experience so they can become full professors. That being said, at least when I was in academia back in the dark ages, you needed an MS in the subject you were teaching to be able to teach undergrad. "

2539,How valuable are MBAs nowadays in the workforce?,"Currently, I’m finding that an MBA is worse than totally useless. It may be actually driving people away from me. Have only had one face-to-face interview in the past 5 months, and it had nothing to do with my MBA. "
2540,How long should I wait for a promotion,"But you directly asked about a promotion? That’s a conversation I’d recommend having in person, but definitely set up a meeting with them if you can to discuss. Or at the very least ask if you can put something on their calendar.  I wouldn’t wait too long, especially if they were unclear about next steps. A week to have a talk about it is definitely plenty of time, unless you all are ridiculously busy at the moment. 

As for the notice for leaving, unless you don’t mind burning bridges, definitely give two weeks once you have a written offer elsewhere. "

2543,Which degree will be best for the job?,I would go get your master’s in HR if that’s what you truly want but I would recommend a Master’s in communications or MBA. I am BA in English. It’s more or less what company will give you a chance. I recommend looking into more than just one career path and look up licenses. I got a license in insurance nationwide and now I’m a claims adjuster 
2544,Looking to get into IT,"Everyone is doing security. 

But there different nature of IT. That is most common thing everyone is leaning towards.

My favorite interest is networking. You understand how Information is traveling on a infrastructure. You learn the behind scenes stuff. And it pretty amazing.


Networking
Security
System Admin
Programming. 

Most of all learn about your own computer. 
Learn about local users and group policies 
Most of Submitting and IP addressing. 

Play around with command line

I always asked my senior co workers for advice and they gave me that piece. From their I did my own Independent research. 



While your looking , look for entry desktop support jobs to help you learn while you educate yourself. This will definitely help you and help you engage in asking questions. 

People at work are willing to help you learn. "
2545,What are the best skills do I need to find a job in US as a foreigner?,"Hey one more idea.  Learning/getting certified in a software relevant for finance can be really helpful.  Maybe Oracle, SAP, or something similar.  Certifications for these are long and expensive but can be done from any where in the world and gaurenteed to open doors "
2546,Losing hope in finding a job with a degree. How do you get a job with no experience?,"California and washington have a living minimum wage, mabe you can start there "
2547,Does identifying as LGBTQ in job application improve my chance for being hired?,I hope not. Not because I have anything against LGBTQ but because it's not a reason to be hired 
2548,"How to ""demonstrate knowledge"" in a job application?","They want to see work that reflects knowledge of these things. A project, a report, some program or processes you helped develop that pertain to these policies/acts... etc. "
2549,Why don so many “Office Assistant” jobs require Bachelors degrees?,"Like the other person said it decreases the number of responses for the position. Another way of looking at it is that the employer knows he/she can get a more educated person because the market is flooded with people of that background that need a job but could not get it into their fields. 

That being said, I've actually encountered the opposite. Many of those type of positions rather have a person that has accumulated 5 years of experience for example, instead of a person with a Bachelor's degree. 

Also, many jobs in the business world are clerical in nature. Not everyone is an analyst or a manager. There are many support roles that require specific knowledge of software and processes. Not rocket science, but an easy way of eliminating people so that they don't have to go through all those applications. "
2550,Recent grad in Sociology and completely lost,"Sounds like you don't know what field to go into.   

Take a Myers-Briggs test, free ones are online. Then google ""jobs for INTJ's"" (or whatever your personality type results from the test) and you can see what jobs are good for you. 

If you're not qualified with a sociology degree, perhaps take some online courses (free ones) and use that as your education? "
2551,"3rd Year College Student - No clubs, no internships","I have a language degree... it's not sociology, but it's in the humanities. Try looking at management/management trainee positions. They might not be what you want, but they're something... plus many of them pay fairly decent. You can totally have a job and be looking for one at the same time. Also, the military is an option (a bachelor's can get you into OCS, provided you meet the other qualifications). There are various other government jobs up for consideration as well, and many of them require a bachelor's degree... no mention of specific concentrations. That goes for federal, state, and local governments. Your GPA also qualifies you for teaching, I believe. Depending on your state, you may be able to work without a certification. There are all kinds of jobs out there for people with these kinds of degrees. Your path may not be completely mapped out for you from day one like it is for some majors, but you have options. If you really want a job specifically within your degree field, you will probably need a master's at least, although again, government jobs often only require a bachelor's. "
2552,Increasing skills/qualifications for free,You can learn how to use almost an computer program you might use for free by lookin up tutorials.  I just got adobe creative cloud at work and this is how I am learning to use its programs to help me do some stuff better. 
2553,Can I exaggerate on my resume?,"Apply! what’s the worst that can happen? Exaggerate, but don’t lie. Sell yourself, what do you want them to see? good luck "
2554,How do you know what you're doing with your job?,"Some people have to take on new tasks at work and I’m sure they then look like they have no idea what they’re doing because they’re learning. 

Some also way oversell themselves to get hired and of course, when asked to do stuff they said they could do, they don’t know how.

Just be honest about what you know how to do and what you don’t. "
2555,ELI5 what exactly a promotions and publicity manager does for a book publishing company?,"It's a job for someone with a lot of media contacts.

The duties are varied, but the outcome is to get books featured in media: TV shows, radio shows, articles, blogs, etc. "
2556,What is favored for a specific job or internship? Education or work experience,"Depending on the numbers both would likely get an interview.

I would expect the person with experience would be able to give more concrete examples and interview better.

If you are choosing, take the work experience. For most fields, people do masters when they can't find a job or don't know what they want to do. "
2557,How do you deal with having a vastly lower skill level than your coworkers?,"I try to comment on these posts if no one else does, even if I don’t have much experience in this scenario. There are a few options that you could do here and different perspectives you can use.  
  
A) Your other employees have a different mindset than you and you come from a different background. You come from the business world and they’ve come from cs and big companies. Different viewpoints help a company as a whole and you being young to this job (because you’re an intern), you’re not expected to know everything, just a higher general understanding. Maybe on your free time try to learn SQL or other useful skills that could help not only this job, but potential future ones.  
  
B) Talk to your boss and see why he offered you a job to provide some like so you can improve your self doubt. Maybe try mental health consulting if you think you need it (I am just going off of the imposter syndrome you explained).  
  
C) Ask for help from a coworker or two to help train you more? Since you don’t want to move back, view this as some money is better than no money. Think of what tasks you do on a daily basis that you could do better and practice them.  
  
Motivational bit: If you’ve been lucky enough to be selected by them twice, once for interview and once for a job offer, they clearly see something in you that you don’t. You clearly want to stay there and I believe that you can beat this challenge that’s in front of you no problem. You got this because you’re already starting to ask from help, now ask from help from yourself to believe you can do it! Good luck! "
2558,How much experience do I need to get a non-entry level job in retail?,"Usually the requirements include 2 years college, 1-5 years supervisor/ management experience depending on the level position you're applying. "
2559,Proof of Bachelor's Degree ?,That document would be your transcript. Unless you lied about your grades or degree it shouldn’t an issue right? 
2560,Have you ever applied and got a job you thought you were not qualified for?,"I eventually got the job. It was in a totally different field and a position that sounded waay to fancy for me. They were willing to train people which helped a lot, but they also liked that I was quick to learn and after three week my boss told me that they thought I was perfect for the job. It's been 6 months and I'm still here! "

2568,Should I still apply if while I am filling out the application it asks if I am 18 or older and I am not 18?,"A lot of the applications will ask, even if it isn't a requirement for the specific job.

If it's a hazardous job, one that requires handling alcohol, or one in a location that requires customers to present ID to enter, I'd skip it. Otherwise, if it's a job you're qualified for, go ahead. All they can do is file 13 it. Just don't lie. "
2569,What skills could I learn at home that will significantly improve my employability?,"Do you have work experience? 

In truth if you can take a workshop or class in a skill (like Excel for basic proficiency) and give a description of what it taught on your resume - it makes a difference

You can list something like a lynda class or even a university/library class. Fwiw no background check will can confirm or deny if you took it but you still have to demonstrate proficiency (obviously) if, say, you're tested "

Instead of going to college or university I spent some year working while I taught myself how to program. Got my foot in the door at a small company. 

You have also noticed one of things most people notice about higher education graduates, they barely know a thing about doing their job, it's virtually worthless as an indicator of how well they will be as a software developer, the only thing it actually tells you is they were willing to put in the time it take to get the degree.

The only thing a degree will really do for you is open up a few job opportunities, some companies are really hung up on only hiring people with a degree. But currently in our field there are plenty of place you can hop around to, if you just want a raise. With 7 years experience you could (probably, I'm not really familiar with the german job market.) easily find a higher paid job without wasting time and money on a degree.

I myself spent some time chasing money and got about 30k more in compensation per year (after 2 job hops). "

Never assume and there’s never a guarantee how long it’ll take to find a good job. Don’t put it off. At the very least an hour a day and pick up new job skills.

2602,How do I find a job in the current situation (from being currently unemployed)?,My advice would be to keep checking in with all your recruiters so you stay top of mind. Given the current situation there will be a lot of uncertainty and delays/hesitations from companies. So the best you can do is to be visible to your recruiters so they dont forget about you. Other people will be waiting silently so its the best time to make yourself visable. Remain hopeful and all the best. 
2603,"Been Jobless Since September, don't qualify for any type of support. What can I do?",Have you spoken to a recruiter? 
2604,Have not heard one word in over two months from one job since temp closing due to Covid. Is this a good reason to start job hunting?,"I got laid off in March. Started nannying for my little niece right after. My soon to be brother and sister in law's companies are paying me to help with my expenses.

Havent heard anything. I had an administration position I loved that I could do good for the community in. Little room to move up. It got me thinking about the future. When we closed they said our jobs would be safe, but as of now I am laid off. I have no direct association with my company. My section is not even the first to come back. I remember the email and I just cried.

Got an interview today(applied two days ago and their recruiter reached out) and it made me super happy. Even if I dont get it: it still felt good knowing I have hireable qualities. I got laughed at when I suggested my pay to be so low and I saw him write down a much much much higher number. 

Now, I dont know if your job is toast but use this time to revise your resume and look into other opportunities at least! May not find anything, but you may find something. "

2611,Get Unemployment Benefits From a Year Ago?,"I am in a totally different state, but I highly doubt you could do what you're asking. In my state, you must have made at least $5000 last year to qualify for UI. And regular UI only lasts something like 12 or 13 weeks, so if you're eligible there's no way you could get nearly a year of retroactive payments. If you could stay on UI that long, it would be that much harder to keep people from abusing the system. It is designed to help people who lost their job through no fault of their own for a limited time so they can afford the bare necessities so they don't go bankrupt while looking for a new job. Not so people can get as much as they can out of the government (that money comes from everyone else's taxes from the money they worked hard to earn). 

Now, my state has a COVID hot spot and so many people have lost their jobs that they've developed a new ""Pandemic Unemployment Assistance"" which is sort of the same, but can last longer than UI. You may be eligible for it if your state has it, but I believe you still have to have proof of earnings and proof that you have lost your job due to the virus, so you may not be. "

There's no harm in looking around or applying now, but maybe don't quit before you have something lined up.

When he interviewed for a position with a company, the interviewer mentioned that they'd like someone that could be on the ""safety team."" Turns out that the only requirement was CPR certification. Something like an extra dollar per hour on his payrate. 

Google has free courses on some of their marketing tools. That's not exactly a certification, but again could be one more thing to set you apart.

Or start learning a new language. Plenty of apps to get started and other resources available at your library. "
2633,Question About Unemployment,"Since you got laid off before 4/1/2020, unemployment income counts from 9/2018 to 12/2019.  For NY, you only worked for 1 quarter.  For NJ, you've worked for all 5 quarters so you should qualify for unemployment provided that your salary was decent enough.

I would say go ahead and fill unemployment with NJ. "
2634,"(23m) Communication graduate, four years unemployed.","First of all: I'm sorry to read that you've had such bad luck on the job hunt. I know that is really disheartening, because I went through the same thing 5 years ago. I didn't really know how the game worked, back then. But I do now.

So the good news is that there is a lot you can do to improve your chances!

You mentioned that you've applied to 80+ opportunities. This tells me that you're using some standardized process for your applications. You're basically submitting the same resume and a slightly altered cover letter in each, right?

Thing is: if you submit standardized job applications, you're likely to get standardized rejection emails.

As any good communicator knows, you need to tailor your message to your audience.

So the trick is **pick way fewer opportunities** and go all in on those.

So go find a company you would really love to work for and do your research. What do they do, exactly, and how could you, bringing your skills, add value to this company?

I'm sure you can think of something, since you mentioned that you pitched ideas to the companies and that they even ended up using them! I'm sure that really stings. But the harsh reality here is that your ideas were good, but the company just didn't trust you to execute on them.

And that's a problem.

Because, as any startup investor will tell you: ideas are cheap. In the end, it's all about the execution. An investor will sooner invest in a great team with a mediocre idea, than in a questionable team with a great idea.

So you need to make sure the company believes you can execute.

Solution:

**Turn a 'we should' into an 'I did'****.**

For example, instead of saying that the company could improve its copy on the landing page to tailor it more to audience XYZ (cheap idea), go ahead and actually rewrite that copy and submit it with your application!

Another example: instead of saying that the company could improve its marketing by increasing its presence on social media, go ahead and actually create a week's worth of social media content for them!

Not only will this allow you to show off your skills, but it will prove that you can do the job before you even have it!

There is no better signal you can give a potential employer.

Finally: **show genuine excitement** for the job in your application.

A standard cover letter is a terrible medium to express excitement. It's frankly plain dull, impersonal and boring.

Remember that you're marketing yourself!

Would you ever choose a ""dear sir/madam"" letter to market anything else?

Probably not.

Making a video cover letter (like with [crash.co](https://crash.co)) will really help you to express your genuine enthusiasm, as well as your communication skills and willingness to go the extra mile.

Good luck! "
2635,2 months of looking for a job and now struggling.,"The UK has one of the worst job markets in terms of applying and getting jobs. It's very much who you know and the culture fit rather then your ability.

If I'm honest as someone who found it extremely diffcult in the UK then decided to leave (even being British) and was refreshed by a different job market abroad that wasn't so competitive, mates first, extreme levels of favouritism.

 I'd say you made the wrong move, moving to the UK to find a job especially during the peak period of Brexit, employers are finding even more reasons to not hire foreigners. "

2640,How TF do I get hired !?,"So my method was to spam my resume on LinkedIn and Indeed easy apply. Then also sometimes do the application process on their site if I liked the company and they didn't have easy apply. I've gotten a few jobs that way. Like after college type jobs. Don't rule out Glassdoor either. Even Google pulls up job opportunities if you search for it. There's also temp agencies and employment agencies. It's a good idea to make contacts with the recruiters too. 

As far as your resume goes, use a good template. Just make sure to make it your own. I completely redid mine and it made a huge difference. You are in for a bit of a challenge with everything going on. You really need to make sure to stand out. Just keep your resume professional. "

2643,I feel pressured to lie about my employment gap. What should I be saying?,"As an interviewer I wouldn't have an issue with an employment gap that you could explain, but thinking you may be moving into a different field in the future would be a bit of a red flag (because training new employees is expensive).

You could say something to the effect that you were making yourself more marketable, but I suppose that only really works if the classes your taking are in a similar field. "

2662,"Applying for jobs in the past month, no call backs. Should I go back to my old job at a different location?","Don't call, go there in person. Even if you have to wait there for an hour or two until the HR finds the time for you. This way you will have far more success in landing a job than just phone & email. Sure it's oldschool, sure it's uncommon these days. But the HR will see you want this job and you are willing to put some personal effort into it.

You know the pita about managing positions is that people working under you will not respect you. So it is up to you to earn such respect from them. You need to be a friend who is fair and yet at the same time be the father who says no and puts his fist on the table if needed.

No new manager is welcome by anyone. Ever. Unless they are into licking ass. You have to proof yourself, if necessary fire someone if you can choose. Struck fear into the workforces hearts & minds. Show you are willing to do what it takes to improve the business and to ensure the quality of working improves along with it.

&#x200B;

Also asking for a larger starting pay after you pussy out yourself previously, yeah wise move, if you would do that to me, I would open my smartphone, go to instagram, ask you for your name there, check out if you have a girlfriend and start cuckolding you. Did it before, don't mind me doing it again. She will break up with you same day I will fire you for basically no reason but in your files there will be reasons like you stole company property. Aside from that, the meaning is: You gave up, live with same pay as everyone else, you have no ground to be uppity about your payment for starters.

2663,What can I do about my current situation?,"Let me preface this advice by saying that it is my sincere belief that people born after 1990 just really don't understand how powerful the internet is because you've had it your entire lives and just completely take it for granted.

Those of us over the age of 40 grew up in the Industrial Age and as such, we have modeled our Socio-Economic-Political Structure based on the Industrial Age.  Go out, get a job, punch a clock, work in a factory or company, etc etc is all ingrained in our society.  

However, we are now in the information age.  Unfortunately, the inertia of the Industrial Age is still with us and many people, like yourself, are guided by that inertia.

Don't be.

Learn how to make money using the internet.  Notice I said ""learn"".  Every day as a society we spend billions of hours on the internet doing ""Stuff"".  What you need to do is you need to find a way to provide a service for people that use the internet.  What exactly? I have no effing idea.  All I know is that the internet is a giant sandbox with billions of kids playing every day.  There is an infinite market that you have access to.    


What can you do?  Learn how to code, learn how to do Graphic Design, Learn how to do Video Editing,  Learn Social Media, learn about Bitcoin, become an expert at some ""part"" of the internet and then provide some sort of service for people who use the internet.

Maybe you help old people and/or Mom and Pop businesses develop social media profiles, maybe you figure out how to become a virtual assistant and offer your services to affluent types, maybe you build a website selling widgets, maybe you figure out ""something"" that people on the internet can use and you code an app for it....

Here is my advice.  

Watch at least 3 seasons of Shark Tank (doesn't matter which 3 seasons, just pick three), read some books on Entrepreneurship and starting your own business.  go through youtube and watch a few hundred hours worth of those annoying ""Here is how I make money using the internet"" scam videos that want you to buy their bullshit courses.  Do the above for 6 months like a machine and ""something"" inside your brain will click on how to make money on the internet.

You will start by working like a dog and making peanuts, in fact, your internet hourly  wage will probably start off around 5 cents an hour, that is, you work for 20 hours trying to get clients, sell widgets, etc and out of that 20 hours someone pays you $10 for a widget.  You work the next 20 hours and make $25 which comes out to 12.5 cents an hour.  You work the next 20 hours and make $50, then the next and make $100, then the next and make $150, then the next and make $400....   By the end of the year, you've figured some stuff out and now are making more than minumum wage on the internet.  By the end of the next year, you have learned even more and are now making $20/hr... by the end of the next year you are making $100/hr....

You have to learn to hunt and gather for yourself.  We are in the information age, stop trying to live by the old rules and paradigm of the Industrial age.  Educate yourself with the internet.  Yes, it will be tough, yes, it will take a lot of hard work, yes you will have to actually study and read and write shit down and learn how to code and use programs from scratch...  but long term, this is your best path.  It is not easy, it will take you a couple of years, but man, longterm it will be worth it.

Another thing that can help is to partner with someone who is in a similar boat as you are in.  You guys decide to form H&F Online Consultants.  H&F stands for Hustle and Flow.  I don't mean hustle in the bad sense, I mean hustle in the Entrepreneurial sense.  You guys help each other learn, motivate each other, spend every day looking at the internet thinking ""how can we scrape some cheddar off of the mountain of cheese in front of us...""  

You grind everyday with the mentality that you are gonna make money doing ""something"".  You are going to find a need, a niche, an edge that you can exploit.  

that is my advice.  We are in the information age.  The era of working for others hoping they dole out a salary for you is yesterday's model.  Sure, it will work for most but it is no longer ideal.  There is a sea of money out there on the internet right now, you only need a tiny fraction of a fraction of a fraction to thrive.  Figure out how to get that fraction, learn to carve your own niche.

2664,I need urgent help just got fired from my first job out of college.,Sue then dude they straight up fired u cuz they didn't like you. Not qualified my ass. U need to talk to a higher level than HR.

2666,"If given an interview, should I mention that they would be my very first job?",So you lied on your resume? 
2667,Am I at a disadvantage to finding a job because I'm out of the workforce?,"I think it's a just a myth, so think less about it. Just because you're not working doesn't necessarily mean you have lesser chances to get hired. I don't see any logic hiring less qualified candidates simply because they're employed at the moment. In fact, those that are employed sometimes tend to demand more than companies want to offer simply because they got nothing to lose. When a company considers someone who's unemployed, they understand that you're more motivated to start under their terms simply because you need a job. I've been unemployed since last April because my position got eliminated before contract ran its course but I didn't go out searching for a position immediately because I decided to use this time to finish my Master's degree, so I took my time and got it done and graduated in October. Now when I go to interviews and explain the gap, there are no more questions, in fact some even admitted that taking the time to finish school was a good decision. So, as long as you're doing something to better yourself whilst being unemployed is what matters. "
2668,Boss threatening to fire me over things outside my control,"Has she actually provided a valid way to avoid this happening?  For example, 'Oh, make sure you wait to click this button until they pay.'  If there is a way to fix the problem, then you need to apply it.  I doubt that is the case, but wanted to check.

If she hasn't trained you on this, then ask her directly for how this situation is supposed to be handled.  If she starts yelling at you about the waste, just keep politely asking her how you are supposed to enter the order and collect money without entering the order?

If there is no solution, and she is just lashing out at you, yeah, I would start looking for a new job.  I can't say whether getting fired over this would violate the law in Australia, but I will say that it sounds like a toxic, shitty place to work.

If you really want the job, then you probably have to go over her head.  Send an email or letter to her boss, describe the situation, and ask how you are supposed to enter the order so this doesn't happen, as your manager can not or will not explain it to you.  But this is chancy.  It could backfire, and you'll be gone.  Even if it works, be prepared for that manager to hate you until the end of days. "
2669,Should I “give notice”?,"I'm going to give your employer the benefit of the doubt here and assume that the offer isn't some way to cheat you out of employment benefits but rather a chance for you to save face with your former coworkers. 

After all, you don't have to say that you are resigning your position on your own account—merely that you're leaving... "
2670,I can't get hired because I have lengthy gaps in my employment. How do you fix that?,"Open your local food from Home service.

You have no degree, did you graduate high school? 

How old are you?

Do you have computer skills?

Anyone over 20 with only a hs education will not get hired in a traditional office environment.  Your best bet would be a minimum wage gig [fast food or retail].  Save up the money for the laptop off of that.  Dont buy anything special, you are looking for a 200 dollar machine from craigslist that has office already installed-these exist-you might even be able to talk them down.

Beware of the online college thing.  A lot of these are pure scams.  Do the research. "

2679,What steps should one take after being let go from their job?,Get co workers to vouch for you as an employee. Try to negotiate more time to the 1st of March. That way you can say you were employed in March. It buys you more time. Start networking ASAP!

If she was blindsided then it is unfair, but it happens. If she were given multiple warnings and she chose not to improve, then it might just be a bad fit.

**Upwork and Fiverr** treat you like a product on Amazon and take 20% of your earnings to start. You're competing with cheap labor, and you're treated like a sweatshop employee (watching your screen whenever they want, etc). 

**""Free"" jobs sites** are free, so they attract even more competition.

Your best bet is to find a job site that **doesn't** charge a full 20% on everything you make, but does charge just enough to keep the disgruntled ""I shouldn't have to pay for a job!"" masses away (and ideally comes with phone support). [This article](https://hobowithalaptop.com/hiring-part-time-remote-job) explains what I mean a little better.

2700,I don't know how to move on from my unemployment,"As someone who has been in 6 jobs in 5 years after college, you don't have to know what you want to do.  I went from sales, to waitressing, to database management to health care benefit admin, to consulting and now I'm applying to data analyst roles because I find that most interesting.  Find a job,  stick with it for a while and master it.  Then you can look inside your company for other opportunities you'd like to try.  That's what I did with my last role.  You may get some side work, but this will make sure that: 1. you are still getting paid, 2. you are getting fulfillment from your work and 3. you can get more exposure to other aspects/ areas you may or may not be interested in.  The only downside from this side work may be they don't pay you for it,  but it gives you an opportunity to build your resumé for other opportunities inside the company or out.  It also looks good to stay with a job longer so you don't look flighty.  

As for confidence in the interviews- fake it until you make it.  Reach out to anyone and everyone to practice interviewing skills.  The more you practice, the more comfortable you feel.  I'm really good at it if you want to message me.  I'd be happy to help. "

2714,Is leaving a job without another position lined up a death sentence to my career as a working professional?,"Do not quit a job without having another one lined up.

Employers discriminate against people who are out of work.

In addition, while you are employed, you are a ""passive candidate"" and employers think you are more valuable.  So if you quit without without another job lined up, you are at a disadvantage.

>I think she would consider keeping me on the health insurance plan even if I quit as long as I pay the premium.

And where do you get the money if you're out of work?    Your boss has no obligation, to do this.  Unless you're covered by COBRA.

>I’m just tired of wanting to die. I’m not try to avoid work, honestly. I just want less stress, and I’d like to finish ElectroConvulsive Therapy and the day hospital before returning to work.

So don't want to die.    And finish your therapy.   If this is a work related injury, your employer must pay for it.

Look, the US job market is horrible.  Don't do things that will cause your employability to go down.

Do a stealth job search while you are currently employed, this means don't tell anyone at work you're looking for jobs, and tell recruiters not to tell your current employer.   You have an advantage while employed.  Use this advantage to get a better job. "
2715,Graduated college but having trouble finding a good job. Should I join the military?,"I get asked this question a lot as, not only have I written books about it, but I talk about my Navy experience to people asking me if they should join.   


For women, it's an entirely different matter.   


As far as your goals, yes: you would do very well to do the military. Four years really isn't that long of a time and if you have a degree (depending on what the degree is) you'd be able to go in as an officer with better perks, better pay, and a bit of prestige to go along with it. There's more politics involved, but I won't get into that. The reason why I'd tell anybody to get into the military is the Post 9/11 GI Bill. Imagine four years of free college and books AND getting paid the BAH rate of whatever you're in. I'm finishing off the last few semesters of mine right now and getting an additional $2500 a month to just go to school is really nice. Most schools have these programs already set up so all you do is get your COE, apply for classes, and that's it.   


My real concern is with you being a female and what happens in the dark underbelly of the military...the shit they don't talk about.   


This is going to sound like I'm bad mouthing the military, but a lot of dumb ass mother fuckers join the military. Most people have their reasons (you seem very intelligent) but the mass majority aren't. A lot of people join the military because they can't hack it in the civilian world, couldn't/wouldn't get a degree, or chose the military over jail. These are the people that you'll be working with.   


I personally know two females. I'm in contact with one but lost contact with the other a few years after I got out. Both were raped. It's a thing that doesn't really get talked about unless one of them rapes a civilian and there's massive amounts of sexism happening.   


Now, this is all context: I was in the Navy, so if you're to join the military, it has to be the Air Force. Any other branch brings you too close to shit heads that are only there because they had no other choice, and the Air Force will have waaaaaay better opportunities to take what you learn out into the civilian world and thrive.

The people you tell you just to get a job are tone deaf, having a shitty minimum wage job doesn't ""motivate"" you. Suffering doesn't make you stronger that's bullshit.

I know people who downloaded a videogame engine for free (Unity) and taught themselves how to use it and developed mobile apps and make a living doing that. 

You CAN make good money. Yes, it is different from years ago when you got a gig with some big company and that's where you were for your entire career.

I'll say this though: slow down. If your parents are letting you stay at their house, you don't need to get desperate. Keep looking for jobs so you can get your own place, but these things take time and is often out of your control. And another thing, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. Life hits people in different way and at different times, and it's natural to take the option available to you if it meant getting back on your feet. Your CV might look embarrassing from a certain point of view, but remember that point of view is not a far stretch from equating a person's worth with the number in their bank account. Best of luck.

But I told the two friends who had known about the issues I was having at my job right away, and their support was very helpful. 

I can see why you may not want to tell your mother, considering her health situation. I can’t really advise you on that, I think that’s a call you have to make yourself.

If you aren't in therapy, I'd highly recommend it. This attitude of entitlement may be a barrier towards you getting a job. It may also be helpful to practice job interviews and some of the more common questions, as people with autism may struggle more with job interviews.

P.S I want to preface this by saying I'm sure having autism is not easy. I have a few mental health diagnoses myself and was on disability for 8 years as a result. But please try not to get stuck in the ""Because I have this diagnosis, I can't succeed"" mindset, as it just feeds into helplessness and envy towards ""normal"" people. Sure, you may struggle more to get what you want, but you CAN get it if you put in the effort. "

2784,Thoughts on the viability of marketing vs finance vs computer science,"CS has the most immediate potential assuming you go to an average school. Finance is second, marketing third. Stability also goes in that order. 

They can all have “fun” job opportunities and boring ones as well. Marketing is fine but I’d really go for one of the other two if you think one of them would suit you. Personally I’d prefer an extra $50k a year and job stability over a job I enjoy slightly more. "
2785,"Somewhat unrelated, but those of you who took a gap year before college to work and save up money, how did it go?","I’m not sure if I am the answer you’re looking for, but here goes.

I graduated from university and I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life, so I got a job working at Applebee’s and I made about 35,000 a year. This was 15 years ago, so this was a lot of money for a 22 year old.

It wasn’t my plan when I got the job, but I saved up enough money to be able to travel around the world for a year and half and ride my bicycle across America from coast to coast. (I lived with my parents for 2 years, which really helped, too).

Life worked out. I went to graduate school and have continued to work at decent jobs since I graduated. 

Live it up! Take a gap year! Be aware of the costs, but if you’re not going to go into debt, then yes, do it. "
2786,Does it matter which college I go to?,"I'd say that it probably doesn't matter that much.  Unless we were talking about a big name elite type of school, where you go to school might matter to employers a little when you are right at the start of your career and only have a little experience, but probably won't matter too much after that.   Or if you end up moving out of the area after you graduate, it would help a little to have gone to a school that is more nationally known.  So if I were chosing between a school like Akron and a small lib arts school, I'd probably consider cost / debt after you graduate and also just the usual stuff that might be important to you - convenience if you are going to live from home, what student life is like etc.

The other factor is a some schools do better than others when it comes to career placement etc.  And others really have some insane networking going on, both among the alumni and between the alumni and upcoming and recent grads - to the point where you can get interviews or nearly even offers outright if an alumnist works where you are applying, etc. "

2788,What is the worth of a Business Administration degree in the job market? Is it worth it or should I choose a more specialized degree like marketing or finance?,"For my program, I had to specialize between management, finance, or marketing. Business in general is broad and industry would have greater influence in terms of job security. For example: retail, transportation, and hospitality are taking a hit during this pandemic.

My advice would be to understand what you like but more importantly, what you’re good at. The best way is through experience and internships. This will help you  choose a specialization and help narrow the job search. Ideal situation is having a job lined up before graduation which means you’re job searching months in advance. "
2789,What is the best way to a medical career and degree while working?,"Hi currently in Alberta, Canada. Do not come to Canada for a medical degree, it is expensive asf and a month or two ago, our government cut wages and work hours for the education sector, healthcare sector and other sectors I don't remember of and this applies to a lot of places in Canada. Another major problem were having on this side, is that were spitting out more graduates than we can create jobs due to the fact of us being late on expanding a pipeline through a certain place to get more jobs and a foreseeable future but yeah...here we are. "
2790,Teaching Degree and thinking of getting an MBA for Career Change,"An MBA is worthless if you are not already in a business-related career. When I was considering whether to get my MBA I interviewed C-suite execs and Ivy league MBA students about the value of the degree. They all agreed that while the classroom learning was nice, the real value lies in 1. making connections with other successful businesspeople and / or 2. getting a degree was necessary for a promotion in their current job. They also agreed that all of the course contents could be easily found in books and online courses.

Honestly I think your real problem is your expectations. If I understand your post correctly, you hope that if you get a master’s degree, you will be able to change careers. Many people (including myself) have undertaken master’s degrees with this hope. What these people fail to understand is that experience is far more important than education and that sitting in a classroom does not give you job experience. Entry-level jobs require experience and you need at least an internship in a relevant field to be considered for something. Just to use myself as an example, after getting my master’s in a new field I was not even considered for secretarial-level jobs which didn’t require a college degree. This was because I had no actual job experience in that field. I know this is quite anecdotal but if you go on r/jobs or similar forums you can see stories from masters and PhD grads who have been going for months or years without being able to land a job in their chosen field.

Compounding your problem if you want to change careers is that you plan to study in Belgium. Actually I can empathize with you since I got my master’s in a foreign country as well. But this brings with it a lot of problems. First and foremost is not being able to use the resources of the school to get employment. Are you an EU citizen? If not then campus recruitment events and the connections of your profs are pretty much useless since you are not going to be working in Europe. Then you will be stuck cold applying to jobs on LinkedIn that already have 600+ applicants. Trust me, that is not a fun place to be.

Basically, I would advise you not to get a master’s unless you know that 1. The degree is in high demand and 2. You have a plan for getting practical experience during your study. I guess with something like data science that another commentator suggested, that would look like having an internship during your study period AND coming out with strong coding skills and example projects that you could show employers. Not easy to accomplish in the typical 2-year period of a master’s degree but possible for sure. I think that a master's in educational studies makes a lot of sense for you. Since you already have five years of experience teaching, you will be well-positioned to job hunt after you get that degree. But if you are set on getting out of education, then obviously you would need to study a different major.

Just a side note since you mentioned possibly working in HR in the comments: you need HR experience. I graduated with an advanced degree in an HR-related field, publications, conference presentations, HR analytics skills with projects to demonstrate them, etc. Couldn’t even get a job as an HR clerk in positions which didn’t require a college degree. HR is heavily connected to legal compliance and most companies will look for someone who has experience with the legal / regulatory aspects of HR because it opens companies up to lawsuits if the job is done incorrectly. I think other fields would be a lot easier to break into as a new grad and I did find a job in a non-HR field. But that is just my anecdotal experience, take that with a grain of salt if you really have a passion for HR. "
2791,I want to go back to school and I'm not sure where to start. Any advice on which path I should take?,"Why not just attempt to enter the job market?

I know lots of people who have unrelated degrees and work in HR. It's not really the sort of thing where you need a specific degree. A friend of mine has a music degree and works in HR.

Look for entry level or HR assistant jobs and work your way up. "
2792,Do employers actually verify education?,"I mean you were able to explain your situation in a few sentences to us, why is it so difficult to explain it to a hiring manager? I am sure they will understand "
2793,Conflicted about choosing a college major that would help me get a job,"There are degrees that relate directly to what you will be doing, and then there are others that are very general and will fit multiple roles.  In today's economy I'm not even sure which is better right now.  

Something that worked well for me was joining the Coast Guard for a few years.  It paid the bills gave me some time to see the world, and now the GI Bill is paying for my Physician Assistant school.  A degree path I had not considered before.  You could also take a look at the Peace Corp, or something along those lines to give yourself a little time in between years to think things through.  In the long run you may save money by being sure what you are spending it on. "
2794,Will employers ask for my transcript?,Having a commencement/graduation has nothing to do with the record keeping of academics. You should be able to view your unofficial transcript and request an official transcript whenever. What school issues transcripts unless specifically requested? They issue diplomas. I think your verbiage is off.

You'll need to network properly and ensure you have additional extracurricular achievements that set you apart from the brand-name school candidates if you're looking for a role within that salary range. "
2797,Degree in Statistics or Computer Science/Information Technology?,"Do you mean computer science? Or IT? IT can mean a lot of things, but what I'd suggest is studying a combination of stats and computer science. This way you'll learn the importance of statistics, predictions, and data in a theoretical and applied sense. With comp sci, you'll actually get hands on learning with basically how to get a computer to do what you want it to. With these together, you can land any sort of tech job, guaranteed. And it pays well. "

2801,"Employers, how does college education affect your decision to hire someone?","The only time college I saw college being a significant factor was when I did recruiting duty for the securities industries.  We only went to top tier universities for ""Career Days"".  They wanted that ""pedigree""  MBA.

2802,Do Certifications Help with Getting a Job?,"No dude. You can pay and study to get that cert and MAYBE it will count as some college credit in a community college, but it has nowhere near the value of a degree. 

The only value you would really get from that is seeing if computer science is something you're interested in while committing yourself to learning and proving your commitment. 

Otherwise, it really is worthless, and putting that on a resume would get you nowhere. 

Your best bet is taking that course since it's free, committing to it, learning as much as you can then passing it. If you can do that you should consider going to a community college and majoring in computers and working your way up. 

Good luck "
2803,Does my humanities MA give me any kind of edge in job hunting?,"Anecdotally, I’ve heard the opposite—some people with higher degrees have difficulty applying for entry-level jobs. The thinking, as I’ve read, is that you might be overqualified and tempted to “jump ship” as soon as something better comes along. Maybe it’s different with a humanities degree but yea, just might wanna keep that in mind. "
2804,What should I major in?,"Too be honest we can't really decide for you what to major in but you would kinda need to search it yourself on what job you plan on doing. I know a person who has a BA on Computer Science and he hated it. So he currently works at Amazon as a dispatcher because he enjoys interacting.

What can help is what you enjoy doing. Like communicating, problem solving, science, building, managing, Law, ect. If you are afraid of the amount of you will make at the end when you get your major you don't really have to worry about that to an extent but that varies where you live but you should still be fine.

If you really want to start working immediately, get a certificate through whatever community college you’ll get your associates from in something like bookkeeping and then you can get an office job. "
2808,Are multiple Associates degrees worth it? Or just redundant?,"You should only do education that is below your current level (say, going for a bachelors after a masters or an associates after a bachelors) purely for the opportunity to learn and build your skillset. Employers won't care, but you might and there's always more to learn. It's good to be a lifelong learner. "
2809,"Nextopic announcement for our 2nd event, Future of Work!",
2810,What do CS/software employers look for when hiring university interns?,"It depends what you want to do, if you are self-directed and plan to do personal projects then it sounds like the uni that offers that would be a better fit. poopooptootoot is right that past a certain threshold where a university is decent, it does not really matter all that much where you go. Same for GPA, as long as it's decent then no one will really care unless you want to stay in academia. Projects and actual work are far more important. 

The difference where prestige really matters is more on the professional network side of who you meet and what opportunities they connect you with, but again it is perhaps largely luck based and any decent uni will have some opportunities to meet good people. 

The flip side is that it can be better to be a top student at a 2nd tier school rather than middle of the pack or lower at a top tier school, not just from the competitive stress but also from the investment the professors have in you and helping you to succeed. "

2819,18 year old - deciding a major in the U.K.,"Have you tried shadowing or applied for some kind of work experience scheme? In my previous workplace (professional services in a big uni in London), we had a work experience placement for college students, and most of them hadn't decided yet what they wanted to do but they wanted to see how working in an office is like. A lot of young people (including myself a few years ago) have preconceived ideas of what it means to have a desk job or how workload is distributed between departments. I've always worked in non-profit environments (so not a lot of money-making here) but I've always had tons of interaction and opportunities for leadership. I'd recommend that you check out different industries and roles, talk to older friends, etc to get a sense of the kind of culture you'd feel comfortable in and take it from there.

Also, it's important that you study something that you actually enjoy doing because once you're in a course and you have to take exams, the motivation of ""this is going to give me a lot of money in the future"" simply won't be enough. When I was in uni, I had so many classmates that didn't like studying languages and struggled for years with their Chinese classes... What's the point of gaining a skill that you don't like using or that you don't feel confident in? So yeah, maybe you want to minimise the amount of Maths you'll be taking. "
2820,"Got my first real developer job offer that is ""contingent on my earning of a bachelors in May 2020"", but I technically will be one credit off from graduation due to COVID..?","If it’s in the offer, it may have a basis in the job itself/stakeholders requiring the position to be filled by someone with a degree.  First, figure out the quickest real way to finish the degree, a summer class, internship, write a paper, etc talk to your department heads and anyone else at the school then explain the situation to your potential employer work a specific plan and timeframe for the degree, preferably no later than end of summer. "
2821,What certificates actually lead to jobs?,"Trades, especially plumbing, electrical and heating/air conditioning. 

A forklift certificate is a good idea if you do warehouse work. 

Medical certs in phlebotomy and lab processing are good, but don’t pay as much as trades. 

You can get an associate’s degree in nursing but the current employment atmosphere is a bit dicey, to say the least. Still there is plenty of room to move up, if you want to. I do not recommend the LVN/LPN. From what I’ve seen they are mostly employed in nursing homes and those are currently unsafe. "

I've always been an A student and have always loved studying, but I wasn't taught much in college and feel pretty scammed. And especially nowadays where you can study anything you want online, there really is no point in going to college education-wise.

What college can be really good for is networking. Also, my diplomas have really been useful in immigration processes when applying for work abroad. 

Money-wise, blue collar workers make way more than me, and many wealthy business people don't even have a college education.

You should get some experience first, perhaps at least a few years. I agree with all the other commentators; Now is really NOT the time to quit your job. The economic fallout due to the ongoing pandemic is going to be disastrous. I can foresee it will be a few years before the economy is back on track. So stick to your current job because first, you're lucky to still have incoming income and second, use this time to gain experience. By the time the economy is back on track (if ever), you will have gained a few years of experience. Just nice I would say "

2842,(Canada) How important are educational institutions when it comes to getting a job?,"My suggestion for you is to go to UBC or SFU, not BCIT because UBC/SFU are universities and BCIT is a tech/trade school. Universities grads will always get more respect from employers than a tech/trade school grads and therefore, universities grads will get better and higher paying jobs than BCIT grads.

Most UBC/SFU grads end up with great jobs and high salaries because they are good universities but most BCIT grads end up unemployed or very shitty jobs because it is a shitty tech/trade school. "

2847,Useful things to learn for those in the sciences?,
2848,"Is a Bachelor of Arts (Major in Political Science or Economics) enough for a job in Marketing, should I be aiming for a Bachelor of Commerce instead? (Going to get an MBA either way)","What do you want to do in marketing? That will determine what your major should be. My recommendation: Business Analytics, Communications, or Digital Marketing. If you want to do something like graphic design or writing you should minor in those.

Also, as much as they push higher level education in high school, its not necessary in marketing. To give you some perspective, I work in marketing. The jobs go to people who have connections and experience. Most places could careless if you have a MBA. It's really only needed if you move into a director/executive level role. Even then, you'd need many years of proven experience to get that at a company like Disney or Apple. Most companies would pay for you to go back to school if you need it, so its not worth going to graduate school immediately after completing your undergrad.

My advice, when you get into college begin networking the moment you step foot on campus. Join AMA (American Marketing Association) as early as possible. I heavily recommend interning every summer, ideally for a well known company. The internship(s) will give you some experience, but most importantly, connections within those organizations. Check out r/marketing as well. You'll learn a lot about the marketing field. Its much more diverse then most people think. "

2851,"I Want to be a Wildlife Biologist Someday, But I'm still Indesicive because of my lack of Knowledge In this Track. Help Me Please...","hi there. So i have a bachelor degree in General Biology. Here's are some input. 

Fore most, a bachelor in biology, biochem, or chemistry isnt really enough to get the good salary because your competion are those with master and doctor degree. U will most likely need to pursue a master or doctor if u want a good salary. Also a good salary vary...

As for school, it only matter if u looking foward toward a concentration or career. What do i mean by this? Most of the classes of biology are the same regardless where u go, however some schools offer concentrations other university may not. For example, in california; the univeristy in the bay have marine biology as a concentration while those in the central valley dont. Some university offer wild life biology as a concentration and some dont. Some university focus more on medicine sides of biology. Biology is so broad especially at an undergrad level.

When pursing your undergrad, talk to your professors especially the one who focus in your concentration. Get to know them and ask them how u can help on their researchs. For example, when i was taking my pre req for biology, i joined a field biology club and talk to the professor. He offer me a part time position to help with data entry regard to species phenotypes. This experience allow to understand how field biology was different than lab work.

The science u will need to know are physics, chemistry, and biology. The program will teach u and discipline u so dont worry about it for now.

If u go toward biology or any science major, i really really recommend getting a master or doctor afterward.But for me, i got what i needed and took my analaytical skills to run a business because that where my passion align.

I truly recommend majoring in biology, it's an amazing journey and u will learn so much about the natural world. If u have more question feel free to dm me. there's alot more but i cant cover it in one go. "
2852,Graduate Certificate? or Associates? (Post-Bachelors),"I can speak specifically to accounting. An associates degree is a waste of time and money. A hiring manager for an accounting job is very unlikely to be impressed. It will not boost your resume to the top of the stack. How many hours do you need to sit for the CPA exam? If it's one or two courses, take them at the community college and pass the CPA exam. If it's more than that, get a Masters Degree. A Masters or even just being a CPA candidate can impress a hiring manager even if you have little to no experience. 

Also combining accounting with MIS or data analytics is a growing market. People with these skills are rare and so are in demand. There's potential to make big bucks, allowing you to pay off student loans faster. "
2853,Question about a degree - Communications/Marketing,"I’m a Director of Marketing. I don’t disagree that it’s harder to get a job in the communications space (there’s an abundance of candidates for fewer jobs), but for marketing, it depends what you focus on and where you live. I’m pretty much always hiring entry level upstream marketing folks.

What I might recommend is to do a double major in marketing and either accounting or finance. That way, you have a more technical backup degree, and you’re more qualified for marketing jobs if you go that route—lots of entry level marketing folks don’t understand things like budgets or balance sheets.

True executive assistants to CEOs of Fortune 500 companies generally have a degree of some sort.  It helps if they understand business.  Two of our EAs have marketing and communications degrees.

I would say it should be doable because a) Duke has great reputation- when the university is great the major matters a lot less and b) a minor in Finance , as long as you take core Finance courses, should be good enough to prepare you for a start in banking as most of the experience will be learned after college. I'm a CPA and trust me It's very rare to see someone in finance also want to get a CPA. Its doable but likely the CPA prep courses won't be done before you join CPA so thats about 2 years of schooling on top that you need to do to gain admission to CPA. I'd say FOCUS focus focus. Do that degree, get the minor in finance and start a career in banking. And get your CFA while you are at it. "

That being said a lot of PhD programs have recently focused on getting the graduation time down ( I personally did mine in a top research institute in ~4.5 years, our program average was a little over 5).  Its a lot of training but could be really rewarding.

I would suggest reaching out to people that work in research and setting up informational interviews. Theres a wide range of jobs and day to day responsibilities within the industry

Good luck with Liberty National - insurance sales is one of the hardest grinds there is. But if you can kill it you can make a ton. Take your sales training seriously, and be prepared for tons of turnover. If you can sell insurance you can sell anything!

Please keep in mind that I run into many people looking to leave this field - it is a job with more sales focus than most expect and I have heard it is kind of a grind. If you can withstand that though, it can be very lucrative! "

2880,GPA or Co-op experience,"Work experience is much more valuable than GPA if you performed well.

Most places don’t look at GPA as someone with a 3.75 is better than someone with a 3.25.  

GPA is really used to establish a lower bar, in other words most companies have a minimum requirement like 2.75 or 3.00 for recent graduates.  If you exceed that threshold that is all that matters. 

After a few years of work experience no one even cares what your GPA was anymore. 

The only exception is consulting and Wall Street jobs. Going to top schools and maintaining great grades is essential for those jobs, but any other jobs you just need to exceed that 2.75 or 3.00 threshold on a 4.00 scale. "

   Dual degree: Bach of Arts in Economics & Bach of Business in Management

As far as how this is interpreted by employers, I wouldn't necessarily agree with your friend's interpretation.  International degrees usually have to be evaluated by companies here, which look at the country's educational system and the specific credits you took.

2935,Applying for another master's program,"People certainly get into the data analytics world with the pedigree of getting a Master's Degree in it, at least for now, but it all depends on what sort of educational foundation you have to build on.  I'm a Data Scientist who deals in analytics in the infrastructure industry, and I didn't need to get the Master's (or Ph.D.), but when I started out as an analyst over a decade ago, I still had a pretty solid background in statistics, math, programming, and data manipulation from my B.S. in physics.  Much of what I learned in the last ten years (machine learning, Big Data stuff, etc.) has been self-taught from online courses and practicing when opportunities arose at my jobs, but if I didn't have that base from undergrad, it would have all been impossible.  

Even then it took quite a bit of discipline on my part to do the self-study (more than I can muster these days to be honest) because...well, you don't have the validation of professor or mentor suggesting that this investment of your time and energy is worthwhile or leading somewhere.  Plus, employers still aren't sure what to make of skills developed through self-study, so the piece of paper from a reputable institution just gets your foot in the door in ways that some line items on your resume about some online courses you took can accomplish.

So, if getting into analytics is going to be full change of gears with a ground-up development of new skills and knowledge, it might be worth going for the education.  Otherwise, it's worth getting out into the working world and seeing what experiences you can drum up as an entry-level analyst, trying to grow and build your skills outside of work in parallel. "

Once you figure out what kind of he'd  be good at, select one or two that are related to each other and learn about them, like what education and skills are needed. "
2938,What impact would my school conduct record have when I’m trying to find jobs in the future?,Nothing happens. It only matters if you got the degree or are in the process of obtaining it. 
2939,What are some career paths for people with degrees in gender or queer studies?,"HR, activist groups, non-profits. You could also write e-books on queer/gender studies and market them on Amazon. Making money off of e-books will take time, however, and it depends on how much credibility you have and how good of a writer you are. "

2941,Benefits of a Beginner SQL Class? Trying to gain skills for a new job,"I'd recommend to go to half price books or a used book store for SQL textbooks.  The classes I've taken for my software development degree just go through each chapter for beginner level programming.  Download software and practice at home. You could also go to udemy.com and filter for free courses or wait until they have the $9.99 sales.  Good luck!

I feel pretty comfortable with inserting, joining and organizing data.  If the role doesn't not require advanced sql then you should be set. "

2943,MBA Question,"In m opinion, an MBA is worth it if:

* You can get it from a top-tier school.
* Your company will  help pay for it.

The value of your MBA does not lie in the curriculum but in the connections you made while earning  it.   Just keepin' it real yo.  And yes, I have one and I had to take it off my resume, in order to get a job. "
2944,Associate degree in information technology?,"Hey, I am myself doing an AS in IT and almost a year off from graduating and plan on going to WGU to get my bachelors, excluding location, competition, and other things, an Associate degree should land you an entry-level IT job, computer repairs, help desk, etc. People have landed jobs solely on certifications alone. I am actively looking for a better IT job as well with good pay (I'm part-time), it all depends on you, if you want to relocate if you don't find a job near you. But the bottom line is there is value in AS degrees ( AA not so much), AS = getting a job starting out of college. "
2945,BA Graduates: Who works in the field of which they studied in?,"I have a conjoint degree, half of which is a BA in film and media studies. I don't currently work in the media industry but a lot of my fellow class-mates do!

I'm happy that at least some of the people who did my degree are working in the field and a part of me is a little jealous as well.

Even though I'm happy with my current path, can't help but think what my life might be like if I chose to pursue a career in media. "
2946,Majoring in Physics was the biggest mistake of my life.,"I'm sorry, did you bother reading the job description of whatever the hell you were applying for?  Picking a job because it has the word ""Engineer"" in it is retarded.  Incidentally, being a Test Engineer isn't bad at all and you can definitely use your Physics degree for that.  It also opens the door to Quality, Analytics, Performance, Operations Research, etc all of which you can make decent money and stay technical.  

WHen I went to college I will admit that ""Engineer"" was the buzz word of the day and that is what I ""thought"" I wanted to be.  But when I read all the various majors and course descriptions, it wasn't quite what I wanted.  Turns out, the closest thing to what I wanted was Physics.  So I got a physics degree with a heavy emphasis on Engineering courses that I liked.  

Post college when I was looking at various jobs, I didn't really care as long as the job was technical and dealt with technology.  With my physics background I was able to quickly pick up and learn whatever the job entailed.

So Not sure why you are knocking the Physics degree.  To be honest, based on what you wrote seems like you never put much thought into it.  So it isn't the fault of your degree but rather to be quite frank it's your fault for just blindly doing something without doing your own research on the subject. "

2951,"MBA, will it help my career? Unranked vs highly ranked (same AACSB accreditation).","No, it's not worth it at all. I went to a ranked MBA program.

My friend who went to a Cal State regular MBA didn't get any help from his program at all in finding jobs. That's the difference. Even if you are staying at your current company, an MBA from a nowhere school is not worth it.

My advice is to focus on skills that don't require customer interaction such as programming, system/network administration, and security.

No one certification will provide you with enough knowledge to get a non-customer interaction job. 

I don't know what you're current certifications or skill sets, but some recommendations would be ccna, CompTIA security+, Microsoft MCSA, python, VMware VCP, AWS cloud architect associate, etc..

It would help if you posted any current certifications and experience. "
2957,Is a Masters degree really worth it?,"I think it many industries it will help set you apart on a resume and getting an interview and maybe being chosen over another candidate. Just because you have your Masters doesn't mean you will automatically get a job. I think it improves your chances of what I mentioned before, getting an interview, getting a leg up over another candidate with similar skills/years of experience. We also live in the age of basically the Bachelors degree being akin to a high school diploma, so anything above that is nice to differentiate yourself. Depending on cost(cost itself, plus losing out on wages while you are getting it) would it be worth it? It really depends. "

If you can get through an EE course load I’d say that’s much more valuable than a sport & fitness (HNFE) degree. You’ll be able to get a higher paying job out of college and if you truly hate it, you’ll be able to pay to get a degree in HNFE. In addition, you become more marketable later if you have that EE degree as it shows you have the intelligence and dedication to get through The courses. 

If you start taking one or the other and know it’s not for you, don’t stick around in it, though. If you know you’d hate sitting in an office doing circuit analysis or whatever, go the other route. Ultimately you know yourself best. Best of luck "

I made it through a three interview process and due to my experience was offered a Store Manager in Training position. The training time is a small pay cut, but because of the extra hours I will be putting in, I will actually make more than I am now...and even more once I am given a store.

I was very honest about my pursuit of education, as it is very important to me. I switched my major in January to a Bachelor of General Studies with a concentration in Public Health. During my interview with the Regional Manager and his District Manager, both were intrigued when I said I picked something that would apply to my real world experience. I made sure to mention classes, such as OSHA training. I also mentioned that I was simply looking to look better on paper and wasn't necessarily looking for any major career changes. 

I am in my forties and a looking towards the future. Whatever I can do make myself look better and grow is a plus. Where I am at right now, I am the top of the food chain, and if something should happen to the Owner, I am out of a job. This new job offers a lot of benefits that I do not have and an immense room for growth. I have been primary to my job and schooling in my free time...but I will need some time for a few classes on campus and intend on working them in on my off days. Even now, I have too much responsibility to do otherwise. I do worry because I will need to put in at least five extra hours a week. There will also be 5 mandatory lunch hours a week. I haven't had a lunch break in 20 years, so plan on using that as study time.

I will miss my short and zero dollar commute, though.

2967,Studying Master while working full-time on the same field,
2968,Computer science degree or economics degree,"It really depends. If you're looking at something like LSE then econ there can you get you those fat wall street-esque jobs. If you're looking at a regular university, then you have to take a lot more into consideration.

First, how much schooling are you willing to do? Computer science often terminates at bachelors and you go job hunting. The job hunt in Europe for CS is not the same as in the United States. Immigrating here for something like that is even harder and you'll likely face discrimination. Most econ bachelors end up going for a masters/PhD because thats usually the requirement for any job as an economist. The United States has a diverse subset of political jobs that would take Econ degrees.

Second, how much do you care about money? With an economics degree, you will very likely make less than with a computer science degree. If you're more interested in econ than CS and money doesnt matter as much to you, then go ahead with econ. "

2970,"To those who have not gone to college and are instead educating themselves using nontraditional resources in order to advance their careers, how is it going? What are your challenges? What do you wish was different? Would you recommend your strategy to others?","I was in college for business admin but ended up hating it. I dropped out and decided I wanted to do IT work like server admin or something in telecommunications. I found the IT industry was great for unstructured self teaching because it's mostly ticket qualifications which aren't to expensive. But I ran into the problem of being qualified but having no experience and like hell of I wanted to intern for years so I decided to get experience by joining the military. Now I'm getting paid to train on military IT systems. So not only do I get paid training but by the end of my contract I'll have 5 year's of IT experience. it's also opened me up to other areas of the field so if I specialize as a line man I can climb cell phone towers and travel alot amoung other things. Now joining the army.. not for everyone.

If I could say anything about self teaching in the civilian world it would be that you are responsible for the aggregation of knowledge. This is good because you pick what you learn but bad because you may learn advance courses before learning the basics or you might not now subjects exist at all. Your education is also very bias to things that interest you which may be to the detriment of your future employer. a structured college setting avoids this unless it's a bad course. "
2971,How to get into the Movie Industry?,"I work part-time in the film industry in NYC, the best part about this industry is that everyone comes from a super different background. There's a bunch of folks that went to college and studied something totally different than film and folks that never even went to college at all. The best advice would that the industry is heavily favored towards extroverts, since a huge part of how jobs are given are basically from networking. If you enjoy talking to people and are super passionate about film, this can actually be a really great thing! The 2 ways to break in are becoming an extra to meet people on film sets and to find PAing gigs, where you often don't need as much experience, and can observe what it's like working on a film set to gain experience and connections.

There are some schools that offer degree programs (bachelor's, master's, etc.) in occupational safety. There are also certificates for varying levels offered by the Board of Certified Safety Professionals (BCSP). You can also look into your regional OSHA office to see if they offer training or courses near you for OSHA-specific training. 

The majority of people in this field, however, get started in a job to get experience and then earn these certifications or degrees. It depends on the field you're interested in, but you could look for entry-level positions in the construction industry, warehouses/distribution centers, or other places that may need to follow federal regulations.

Check out my post on common questions during various stages:   [My Experience From Job Hunting](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gt144v/my_experience_from_job_hunting/) 

A couple of other thoughts that I had:

* You can always take the job, and keep looking for a new place while employed (getting paid and health insurance benefits)
* I know absolutely nothing about UX jobs, but you said they are getting harder to get.  Why pass on an opportunity that has been presented to you?  
* Is it just the hours that is making you not want the job, not interacting with anyone in the office or is it something else?
   * If its just the hours, again not knowing your personal situation, I would not view this as an obstacle.
   * Is it not interacting with anyone in the office:
      * do you want to be in a office talking / working with others?
      * Is it the commute?
      * Is it concerns about the corona virus?
* Is it pay / salary?
   * again, tricky one with high unemployment.  You can always take it, and keep looking for a new gig.  You can explain that you are looking for a new place since it is a shorter commute, better benefits, etc...
* Did you pick up on a possible toxic work environment? Unrealistic workload / time deadlines, etc?
   * This is the trickiest one.  I always advise people to avoid a toxic work environment as it will demotivate you, which then typically leads to the quality of your work slipping.  Not to mention the anguish this can cause mentally on you at work and at home.
      * Just during the time we are in with unemployment around 20%, this makes it harder to just give a blanked statement of pass on this job since its toxic.

I would take the interview.  I would personally during this time, accept the job since you can always keep looking.  You can always explain an extremely short duration at a job by saying:

* Once I got into the position, I realized that the opportunity was not going to be a good fit for me.  The daily responsibilities and hours were different from what I was told that I would be doing during my interview.  The working environment and culture were completely different than what was presented to me during the interview.  I would like to leave it at that to be polite.
   * remember, don't bad mouth a past employer to a future employer.  This response will typically cease all inquiries from HR recruiters since they do not want to push you into bad mouthing an employee or getting into a potential grey area.
   * be prepared though after this response to talk about the hours and culture that you would work best in or are looking to work in

Again, I don't know your personal situation, but I would point out that the Federal Unemployment of $600 ends at the end of July unless it gets extended. "
2992,Looking at a career change from freelancing and want to know if there are very flexible positions that afford a similar feel to freelancing.,
2993,How to get back job offer taken away by COVID-19?,"Did she give notice at her prior job/is she still employed?

If it was me, I would reach out to the hiring manager or someone I interviewed with -- not HR. They will have a better feel for whether that position will be opening up in the next few weeks/months. Lots of times it depends on departmental politics, and HR isn't always in the loop on that. 

Sometimes hiring freezes end but new job reqs are dropped or go to the bottom of the pile - and by the time they open back up again, it might be a whole new team doing the hiring. 

That said, if this was a vital role and the manager had enough flexibility and authority to immediately offer her several grand above the advertised rate, I think there's still a good chance they still try to offer it to her. 

They needed someone in that role a few months ago.  They'll probably still need someone when this all blows over. "
2994,Making a good impression as a new hire in the time of Covid-19?,
2995,"Working remotely, can I move without telling my boss?",Yes. It’s happening in Sam Francisco already. Rent prices are down 10% because of this and I suspect they’ll keep dropping 
2996,Does anyone feel like the COVID-19 pandemic has set their careers back?,"Graduated in January 2020 and the plan was to look for a good professional job and a minimum wage job as a buffer till my the govt processed my work permit paperwork. Here comes COVID19 and turns my plans upside down - paperwork processing slows down, job market slows down, and I chicken out from searching for a minimum wage job due to the pandemic and parental pressure to not risk health.

&#x200B;

And here I am now, losing hope day by day. All the so-called entry level job openings I see require like 2 years of experience and working knowledge of 3-5 programming languages. The university so did not prepare me for this :-( "
2997,"To those who have returned the office, what’s it been like?","At my work most of my team has been work from home since late March early April, I’ve been willingly going into the office twice a week. We had 2 cases in May so they’ve been taking it very seriously, you have to wear a mask when you’re not at your desk and there’s a person in the kitchen area cleaning everything every time it’s used. Also you have to answer screening questions and take your temperature to get access to the building. Overall I feel comfortable. "
2998,Worried I won’t be able to find a good enough paying job,"I'm sorry you're experiencing this.  I hope for the best for you.  I was in a slightly similar position.  I was at a dead end job.  And i used  the the time in quarantine to take some personality and interest career tests.  O*Net is a good one to start with.  This will open other potential careers titles that you can search for, the best part is that they have separate lists for different levels of education.  I made a list of job titles that interest me, started searching job boards for them and reading all their postings and gradually compiling the skills, qualities and education they were looking for and keeping track of how they word things.

I then narrowed down on the titles or field that i thought i would do well and was capable of preparing for.  Then I sat down and wrote out all.my jobs, all my responsibilities --expanded resume, then googled all the hot key words that recruiters are looking for and how to reword to sound active and how my work reflected that skill. Rewrote my resume and cover letter. I then started looking at various certification programs and the price for jobs that needed more training while i was applying for one's that didnt require certs.  I found that cert programs are often cheaper than a degree.

I don't know you and don't know what the work of strip clubs entail, and I'm guessing you're okay with late nights, so that means you are mentally and physically capable of second and third shift.(They generally pay more)  You are able to multitask or prioritize tasks because you are dealing with loud high energy fast pace people and space.  You are very self aware, you know how to work as a team,  you value safety,  you able to quickly respond to situations, and you probably have great communication skills.

From retail, you have developing customer rapport, understanding customer needs, point of sales experience, teamwork, prioritising , understand chain of command, and maybe creating sale displays.

And the country is slowly reopening. Keep job boards on your phone,  indeed,  glassdoor, linked in.

And you can also spend the time creating a more professional social media personality.  Go through your Facebook, Twitter etc create a Linkedin There are lots of job coaches on youtube too that you listen to.

I know doing these things helped me build my confidence, which now shows through my cover letter, phone screenings and zoom interviews. "

If that's the case I think itd be a lot more useful to just spend time learning something such as a programming language and maybe doing a project on github. Pretty much every field now values programming and data analysis 
3004,"Have an in person interview tomorrow, masks are required. What type of mask is appropriate?","I think people are appreciating creative masks. We all have to wear them, and since they hide a lot of valuable facial expressive information, one that shows a facet of your personality is a good thing IMO. I wouldn't worry about. "

Give them like 4 weeks notice when it's time to leave and let them know you recieved an opportunity to further your education abroad and are unable to pass it up. 

Jobs don't give you notice when they are going to fire or fulough you. They don't always lwt you know you are going to be seasonal. This would be a courtesy on your part and could potentially cost you a job. I would just give extra notice. "
3008,Job description change,Keep your mouth shut and look for a new job. Nobody thinks you like cleaning the bathrooms. Your complaining about it will go nowhere. There is nothing legally binding about a job description. 
3009,COVID-19 Interview questions?,"The only question that I would expect to be asked about Covid-19 is if you are fine wearing a mask or gloves for how many hours you would be working to be able to practice safe social distancing.

Focus on preparing for questions more based upon the role.  Do you have prior experience?  Are you able to use whatever computer program they use or have experience with a similar system?  How have you dealt with upset patients / customers in the past?  Do you know how to work the phone system? etc.

Again, I wouldn't worry about Covid-19 questions.  If they ask anything about it, it is likely to be if you are able to wear a mask/gloves for 8 hours.  If you are willing / able to disinfect the reception area every half hour.

These is a bona fide occupational qualification.  Can you practice safety in the work place?

Asking questions about health directly can lead to a disability claim very quickly if not asked properly.  Employers can ask if you are able to complete the required task. In your case:

* legal question:  are you able to wear a mask for 8 hours? or stated differently, the position requires you to wear a mask for 8 hours. Are you able to do this?  This position will require you to get up every thirty minutes to clean the reception area.  This may include reaching up, bending down, etc.  Are you able to do this?
* illegal question:  Are you allergic to materials masks are made from?  Do you have sensitive skin that would prevent you from wearing a mask? Do you have a bad back that would prevent from bending down to clean?

For example, if you are interviewing to be a security guard:

* legal question:  in this role, you will be required to stand up for 8 hours at at time.  Are you able to do this?  Are you able to stand and walk for 8 hours at at time?
* illegal question:  do you have arthritis? do you have a leg or back problems? "
3010,Offered job (written) in March. Still no start date and I haven't really been updated since. Is it time to give up?,I believe the old saying is don’t stop applying and interviewing until a week into your new job. If it’s been 3 months and no one has reached out I would ask if that employer is worth it. 
3011,Is this a bad time to take a new job offer?,
3012,Should I wear a face mask for my job interview?,100% yes. 
3013,"Working remotely due to pandemic, should I tell my boss I took a trip to another state?","You should tell him. My company is working remote with no set date of return. My county only has one COVID case right now and work has put out a temporary policy that if we travel they have the right to ask us to self quarantine for 2 weeks. 
This is mostly because I work for an essential manufacturing business and if someone in the plant were to get sick it could spread quickly and cost $$ if we were to shut down, and less for the folks in the office, but the policy still applies to everyone. "
3014,Can I be a contact tracer for a different state?,Yep my gf is doing this for another state. 
3015,getting a translation job,"Any online platforms for remote translators. Like Fiverr, Glassdoor, LinkedIn (create a really good profile and start adding people in the translation field, recruiters and just random business people), freelance websites, etc. You could create an ad on Facebook and promote yourself there. Send out a message to all the people you know and ask who needs translation services.

One more advice I'd have for recent graduates would be: don't set very low prices because you'd be hurting the whole market! We experienced translators often struggle negotiating prices because there are so many cheaper options from less experienced folks. "
3016,Would this be a good time to relocate for a new job?,No. I wouldn't be making any major changes like relocation right now. 
3017,Just Got Laid Off Over The Phone,Why didnt you search for a new job while you were furloughed? You need to start doing that. 
3018,"Uncertain if I should pivot, change careers, or just keep applying like mad?","I see lots of IT and paralegal positions all over Northern California, are you maybe living in a slow economic area?

3019,Returned check.,[deleted] 
3020,How to go about contacting employers after a hiring freeze?,"I think it would be worth reaching out once the company has actually reopened. Right now, their focus is likely on getting things moving again and then they will worry about hiring. If you were to reach out now, I think it might be too early. Keep an eye on their job boards, though, and reapply if you see the job posted again "
3021,Which industries do you think will grow & thrive post COVID-19?,"Everything will  eventually go back to norm, but the tech industry think FAANG is always a safe bet as long as those companies continue to grow, innovate, and compete. "
3022,Coronavirus affecting (data science) job offer,Any job offer in India right now will probably be a bust in any field. Their borders are closed and probably will be till the case numbers drop there. Many countries are like this right now. All the companies here with data science jobs (Canada) are not interviewing foreign workers unless remote and mainly staying to only hiring domestic. The exceptions are in the medical field and farm pickers. 
3023,My job is starting to invite people back and many people are mad about it,"Honestly, I'd be ecstatic to get invited back to my job because I was part of the full-time crew that got furloughed in early April, not being paid (but still receiving medical benefits). Other full-timers didn't get furloughed and others still have already been invited back over me, which is frustrating on my end.

I would think the part-timers would have more reason to be pissed than the full-timers. "
3024,should i wait for my company to call me back???,
3025,Will workplaces start spying on us?,Already going on. Some guy got fired today for some bullshit along these lines. 
3026,Spent 14 years of my life to become a Physician Assistant and now I'm expected to clean bathrooms at the office. What should I do?,She should suggest they hire a full-time cleaning person. 
3027,Furlough Situation.,"First, I'm very sorry this is happening. 

I'm not sure if it is or isn't in the bigger picture. 

Let's say you earn (pick a number) $70,000 / year.   Is it foreseen that you, in your position, will generate $70,001 or more for the company in the period from 19 May 2020 to 19 May 2021?  

And if not, then the company has two options:   

1. cut your salary to $69,999 (but a more round number like a 20% cut is more the norm, however it alters employment contracts and can leave a company open to labour board appeals), or 

2. cut the position, and disperse the job to people who are earning $40,000, and have that $30,000 gap make up for not only the losses encumbered from your salary, but also the efficiencies you generate (ie: are you generating $70,000 salary equivalent + $30,000 efficiency equivalent / year = $100,000 per year generated by you for the company?)

When the going gets tough, and if it's no longer clear, and if they're not convinced you are generating more than they spend on you, then layoffs happen.  And it's a lot tougher to justify efficient work habits and behaviours when customer revenu drops more than the efficiencies you deliver.

Regardless... from a human standpoint, this is an awful thing you're facing, and I feel for you.  I'm very sorry you have to go through this.   Stay strong.  Good luck. "
3028,Anxiety/depression and returning to work after COVID lay-off,"I have been in a very similar situation. I strongly suggest pursuing the short term disability option. You don’t need to prove your history with depression or that it’s not “covid anxiety.” I’m in the US so maybe it’s done differently in Canada, but here when you apply for short term disability you would just need your psychotherapist (as long as they have a PhD) to write you out and list your depression and anxiety as the disability. It sounds like your psychotherapist acknowledges the effect your toxic work environment has on you and so would likely agree to do this. "
3029,Job not Taking COVID-19 Seriously,"What state do you live in? In Texas, if you tell your boss (in writing so there’s proof) that you don’t feel safe due to x,y,z, and they don’t fix it after multiple times asking, you can quit and collect unemployment!

Not sure if your goal is to leave because you feel unsafe, or just want to make a change at your work.
If you want, you can also oust the company on Facebook or Neighbor app... but it seems like the people in your area generally don’t seem to care about the virus. "
3030,No Written Offer yet but it's a pandemic. Should I be worried?,"I received a similar verbal offer from my internship site only to be almost immediately replaced - not to scare you, but follow up and ask to be CC'd on communications between the person who offered you the position and HR. Be in the loop! "
3031,Rude hiring process?,"I agree with you.  I interviewed for two positions (promotions) in my organization toward the beginning of the shelter in place and have not heard back since.  I've had more than a dozen interviews there and usually hear back in a couple weeks (yes or no).  I would assume that this organization is also struggling with the risk management side of how to safeguard current employees as well as how to safely onboard new hires.

I wouldn't let this spook you.  You were just caught in the middle of a shitty situation.  Take the win and congratulations. "
3032,Paid Internship Tips,"There’s pretty much nothing else you could do, just keep applying to internships. You shouldn’t feel like you’re failing to secure an internship this summer because they are so few and far between nowadays. If you do get an opportunity to intern then you are really fortunate. I know many companies have rescinded offers to my friends because they can’t justify hiring interns when they’re cutting their workforce. I consider myself lucky to still have an internship this summer, but it’s nothing like what I signed up for- shortened to 4 weeks virtually. 

Future employers will understand if you weren’t able to get an internship this summer, so don’t worry if it means you have to take on a different job. "
3033,Tips for being Trapped for the Pandemic,"I’m in the same boat as you - I was starting to submit applications for new jobs right before the pandemic hit. My job has little growth opportunity and I had been feeling trapped for a few months before I started looking at new jobs.

Things have gotten worse with the coronavirus and WFH situation, with the company adding on way more responsibilities due to the increased disorder and frenzy. I receive messages and calls at all hours of the day. It’s gotten out of hand and the “trapped” feeling is just magnified. 

I have tried working on solutions with my supervisor but the attempts so far have done very little to ease the workload and expectations. 
I usually take pride in my work and have a fear of underperforming, so I tend to forget that a job is just a transaction. I dont know if you feel the same way but I hope it helps you out to remember that you won’t stay in this role forever, and in the meantime just go through the motions of your job and find something you like to do to ease your stress when your day is done. For me it’s been Animal Crossing and reality TV haha. 

In the end, since the volume is high and it’s out of your control, and it’s a job you are looking to leave in the future, do you care about your performance? For me, trying to let that part go (caring about doing well) has helped.

Edit: just wanted to add another comment on what you said about being lucky to have a job right now. I understand that feeling and the guilt associated with wanting to leave. There’s nothing wrong with feeling upset about a job that you hate, no matter what the situation is. If it’s mentally taxing and affecting your health, it’s a valid concern. "
3034,Jobs worth the training during quarantine,
3035,Employer Forcing People Out - How to respond?,"If you wind up quitting, file for unemployment compensation due to constructive dismissal. Keep records of each inappropriate occurrence. Tell your disabled coworker about this too. "
3036,Should I follow-up with the company (again) or let them reach out to me?,
3037,Had a message from my boss that I should 'keep my options open'!,"They may not have made the official decision to lay you off yet, but it sounds like layoffs will be coming. If you want to be ahead of the curve I'd start looking for a new job now. "

sue the company? ask your lawyer? "
3040,Should I contact company who said I would be interviewed but they are reviewing the situation because of coronavirus (they emailed 1 month ago),"If it’s been over a month, I would definitely reach out. I was in a similar situation. It was a major relief to hear that I was still an interview candidate and was given a bit more information about why and how the hiring process has been frozen. If you don’t reach out, they may think you are no longer interested.

If it has only been two weeks since last contact, I would hesitate to reply, but likely would choose to check in anyway—just to show continued interest. In normal circumstances (sans epidemic), I’ve read it’s normal to reach out within 5-7 business days. "
3041,Advice on how to quit a job I just started and that I work remotely?,Call your boss and tell him over the phone and then follow up with an email. 
3042,I have a feeling my office might not take me back—does it sound like I need to job hunt?,"Law offices have definitely taken a hit, most courts and legal proceeding that aren’t essential have been postponed, real estate law proceedings are on hold, etc so it’s more than likely they’re assessing if they’ll be able to afford you before they commit to hiring you back.  In this case no news yet is good news. "
3043,Interviewing/job-seeking etiquette when furloughed,"Are both companies in the same industry or is one more or less “safer” vs the other with regard to post covid? Remember that the economy will not just totally open overnight and we still have a ways to go even though we are seeing glimmers of hope.

Given the current work from home rules most companies have had to implement, if you do get an offer from the new place, you could accept and test it out since I assume it would be remote. I actually just did that as I started a position before covid but had still been interviewing at another place for a job I REALLY wanted. I got the second offer and took it since all work was remote. I’m so glad I did because I love the new job and I’m taking a bit of a pay cut, but not only to I like the position and company more, their future outlook is much less risky in my opinion due to their industry. 

The other company understood when I let them know, and I wasn’t even on furlough. I think all companies understand you have to look out for yourself right now and just being open and honest and even leaving it up for discussion when things open up, you will be fine.  One thing is I wouldn’t push to hRd for a higher starting rate rn. Don’t be taken advantage of,  but even companies benefitting from covid are in a weird place and unchRtd territory, so cash flow is crucial. I’d push more for a raise at 90 days after review to help balance that. "
3044,University job I interviewed for frozen due to crisis - what do I do now?,"Higher ed is in a really bad spot right now. They had to refund students for meal plans and housing when they closed their campuses, costing millions of dollars. Plus on campus programs that generate revenue aren't happening at the moment. "
3045,Would an employer be understanding if someone else were to drop off your resume while you’re in isolation?,[deleted] 
3046,Should I disclose pregnancy to new employer before drug test?,"I'll try to offer 2 sides 

As a company they would find it bad manners that you did not disclose to them that you were pregnant and you would probably only work their for 3 months then take a break and come back at a later date. Since then they have to find someone to replace you for the time you were gone and its getting expensive to keep you. 

The other side it should not matter because you will come back. A company has no rights into your personal life. 

My only thing is can you perform the requirements while pregnant? Also maybe down the line see if you can work remotely from home. "
3047,"I want to quit my job to avoid exposure to covid, but fear loosing a good reference.","Just talk to your manager, and let him/her know how you’re feeling. And suggest taking a leave of absence instead of quitting if needed. But your manager sounds like he likes you, so if this is going to change that, shame on him.

But also, you’ve worked there 8 years, that is reference enough for you. Rarely will anyone contact your manager anyway, and they normally take previous employer’s opinions with a grain of salt. "
3048,In-person Interview During Pandemic,
3049,Temporarily laid off but was told to “find something else”,"Hey! This is almost identical to my story. 

I just graduated in December and been working for a very good company. 

I was laid off in March, when I tried to get an update on when I will resume, I got message from the HR to “consider other opportunities”.

This was my first time laid off, felt like I just went through a broke up, damn.


I had improved so much for the last 3 months working there, I just got an opportunity to lead a very exciting project and this covid situation came. Thinking about all this right now really hurts.

Just let you know there are someone on the same boat! We will get through this. "
3050,NYC security guard license,
3051,College student working as a tutor and a pharmacy assistant looking for a new job during COVID,"Just stay in your current job and look for what to do when the economy opens up more. Search for jobs similar to what you do so you’ll know your qualifications will be accepted. 

Most jobs are labor types of deals. You could work in a warehouse if you want or deliver packages. "
3052,Feeling uncomfortable & unsure what to do,"It sounds like you're being asked to do something potentially unethical. You either deprioritize it, fight/potentially leave because of it which could impact you financially, report it with evidence as a whistleblower to a government regulator, or grit your teeth and do it. Ultimately the choice is yours depending on the specifics of the situation and what you feel is right.

Your job is not all you are though, try to compartmentalize and separate poor management from reflecting on yourself. "
3053,"Quarantine Delivery - which company is best (Doordash, Postmates, Uber Eats, Grubhub, etc.)?","It really depends on your market. I've been running with DoorDash and it's not bad, you can get started with it pretty quickly too. A lot of people actually deliver with both DoorDash and Grubhub or Uber Eats at the same time to make up for when it can be a little bit slow, and those will probably be your top 3 apps in almost any area. I'd just search up the top third party food delivery company for your city and start from there, then add on another account when you feel comfortable. Also maybe check out the driver subreddits like r/doordash_drivers for some extra tips on making as much money as you can. Good luck. "
3054,Apply for decent remote job or build portfolio and hope in-person work starts again soon?,"It sounds like you just really don’t want the job. I agree w others that a paycheck is crucial right now. If you get experience while getting paid, you’re doing pretty well in the midst of this crisis. I hope everything works out for you! "
3055,Should I take reduced hours/reduced pay?,"Yes, if you are fine financially and it seems to make sense, then go for it. Time is valuable, ultimately by the end of your life it is worth more than money. If you have not taken a break since 15 then you are long overdue and this may be an unexpected opportunity for you. If the company is asking for volunteers too, then they will appreciate you taking one for the team. "

3061,"Was hired for an NYC office position with new company, but with COVID-19 and my wife's new position, how can I have a conversation about being transferred to the Los Angeles office?",

3064,Actively looking for a job during lockdown?,I am in the same situation.. I am thinking of just handing my resignation soon without another offer at hand because I am not happy at where I am right now. but the general advice now is to try to get another job offer before you quit.  the covid situation is definitely not making it easier to find another job. i also think it is better to attempt to make a switch early now as i foresee more layoffs later which will intensify the competition for job seekers.

3068,Regretting taking part-time summer job?,"Are you worried about it being safe because of COVID-19 or in general.  In terms of the virus, you would of course take necessary precautions as you would in public anyway - masks, gloves, disinfectants, etc.  But if you’re terribly worried and don’t need the money then sure pull out, I’m sure they have a backlog of people who would be able to replace you quickly.  Personally I would work the job, but if you’re terrified to then you have to weigh what’s important to you. "

3070,"Struggling to find work in my field and I want to change careers, but not sure what the smartest steps during a time like this.",Look for web development jobs and expand your background with more programming languages/certificates. Take advantage of the downtime that COVID-19 is giving you to learn more. 
3071,How can you ask about the security of your employment?,don't waste your time.  They will never tell you the truth until they are signing your walking papers.  Just assume and prepare for the worst.

3075,Leave apprenticeship after this corona pandemic or hold on to it till the economy bounces back?,"I’d continue working and look for a job. A month or two probably wouldn’t be a big deal but if two became six it’s more likely you’ll regret it. Just start applying, if you land a handful of interviews and feel confident you’ll get something in a couple of months max then maybe you quit. If you get zero responses or nothing looks promising, maybe you stay. "
3076,take unpaid time off due to fear of COVID19?,"I’d push harder on working from home. They say they don’t allow it, but if tell them that you’re no longer comfortable coming to the office so you either work from home or go on unpaid leave they may change their mind. "
3077,Customer claimed he had the virus and they let him go.,"What is there to do? You’ve done all you can do: you’ve cleaned things, you’ve washed your hands. There is no additional action to be taken. If you come down with symptoms, go to the doctor.

Also, he’s lying. Hospitals don’t keep people with no symptoms for two weeks, so there’s no “releasing” him. "
3078,Is Covid-19 pandemic affecting the length of prehire screenings or am I being impatient/paranoid?,"Yes. Thankfully since I've been contracting with them they are bypassing the drug screen and are going to take whatever background check they can get.

They did say, however, that when things start to open the background check could come back with something and I'll be fired if there's something on there. Thankfully, I'm clean, so shouldn't be a problem.

This was a special circumstance though. Most other positions are in hold. I'm guessing most other companies are trying to pivot and deal as needed. And public companies are probably even harder hit. "
3079,I quit my job last week and now I’m regretting it. Advice?,"Oh man, been there, done that. The only reason I'd tell you you should have sucked it up, is if it was your only option. That is, it was your only means of income and without it, you'd literally be on the street. My saving grace was an emergency fund. The job I quit, had veins popping out of my head, felt like my throat was seizing up, seriously considered driving off a cliff rather than go in, and for nowhere near enough pay to deal with it all to boot. Yea, I had to leave in a hurry.

But, since your husband can cover while you look for a new gig, don't sweat it. That guilt you're feeling will pass in a month or so, or it did for me anyway. "

The challenge you will have is that you may not have a lot of leverage if you don't have a job and if they don't need the position filled AsAP, but the core ideas of the negotiation should still work for you.  Do your research and try not to negotiate against yourself. "

3084,What's the most absurd/bad thing your employer has told you during the covid-19 lock down?,A friend of mine was offered an unpaid extension to his paid fulltime 80K/year contract that ended end of march.

The protocol exists for a very serious reason. If your company things you should stay home then stay home. It helps no one if you infect coworkers. Even if you lose your job it's not worth infecting people. "

What is that. "
3098,"Accept new, possibly more secure, position or stick with current job and hope covid doesn’t leave me jobless in a month?","You got to remember that this will all eventually end, when that is, is the question. If you truly feel the industry you are currently in is doomed and the writing is on the wall for an eventual layoff, then I would use this position to negotiate a higher salary with the new offer. Remember that is just their initial offer and it’s good to become well versed in the art of negotiation. What they offered is not written in stone. Let them know the situation and tell them you like the company and potential of where you could go in it but the salary is a bit low. Ask if they can match what you’re currently making, if they say no (strong possibility in this climate) ask them to meet half way at least and justify it. This is also a good time to negotiate more vacation time (if you care). It never hurts to ask and all things considered they both seem like good companies. Good luck and sorry about your father. "
3099,Boss demanding more work with no pay increase/overtime,"In your experience, is my thought process logical when assuming I should stay with a job even if it makes me miserable because “downgrading” would make me a less desirable candidate? "
3100,I went from loving my job to hating it! How can I adjust to this change?,"Just get through it. I'm a nurse at a hospital system who is being asked to deploy for reassignment. Although your job is in a different location, at least it is still in the same capacity. I literally have no clue where they are going to send me, and I have not done direct patient care for a long time, since I'm in education. Thank you for doing your job well, even if it is at a different location. "
3101,Under what circumstances would you ask (or hint at) a supervisor about a bonus?,"Dude you're lucky you have a job. If the company wants to pay bonuses, they will, and I assure you it will not be because you were the first person who gave them the idea. "

My two cents, you really don’t have much leverage right now unless the company itself mandates WFH on an organizational level. I just spoke with my manager this morning who said that they’ll be discussing such options over the weekend, otherwise they expect to see me in the office Monday morning. 

If I were you, I would just ask politely if the firm anticipates any changes in the near future and that you’re flexible with whatever may happen. If you were a long term employee, I would say asking to work from home wouldn’t be an issue but given that you’re really not even an employee yet, you run the risk of starting on a bad note rather than just waiting it out. More than likely, if your role can be done remotely, you’ll know sooner than later what the firm intends to do. "

This is the best summary of the current work environment of the job I am leaving. Toxic, high performers are rewarded, and trustworthy people leave the company. Out of an office of 10 people, 4 of us have quit in the last 6 months. None of us have been employed there more than a year and a half. "
3106,What do you think of shifting schedules? I’d like to hear your opinions.,What does a ICS do? never heard of this before. 
3107,should i quit my new job after 2 months?,"Apply.

But realize that training is minimal in more companies than not.

Telling you to “figure it out” is usually code for “I don’t know how to fix it, that is why I hired you”

Learn to manage your workload better so that you aren’t working weekends.

If it means compressed break times, do so. "
3108,Staying calm while on the phone for customer service in a new job?,"Make a script, write down steps for yourself, slow down and don’t be afraid to have the customer repeat themselves (or repeat their answer back to them to confirm it with yourself).  Basically just slow down, with most jobs like this you can just ask if you can place them on a brief hold so you can figure out what you’re doing or ask a coworker a question.  I’d rather be on hold for a minute while the employee looks something up than have my order messed up. "
3109,Possibly toxic work environment?,Did you ask what you could do better and what did he want improvement on? 
3110,Tips for new hire starting work from home?,"I'm also in supply chain and started a new role about 1 month ago. I spend a lot of time speaking with the team on Microsoft Teams, and although onboarding has been a challenge, I'm getting through it. Just remember that nobody expects you to be an expert right away, give yourself plenty of time to learn. This is your first job out of university, just focus on learning as much as you can and trying to get up to speed as quickly as you can. If you need help, make sure to ask for it. "
3111,Back with previous employer after name change,"From my experience, employers are usually pretty open to these things. They likely even have a name change form or process, similar to what someone might use to change their name following a marriage. However, since you’re just starting, I would just fill out at any forms you already have to fill out using your new name. 

As for in person exchanges, I would just politely say ‘by the way, since I last worked here, I have started going by my middle name’. That should be all you need to say, and likely no explanation needed, would be my guess. 

You may need to gently remind people, but Just be polite, it can be hard on others to always remember to use the new name. 

I think this should be waaaaaaay easier than with your family. "
3112,"PLEASE HELP, I hate my job more then I've hated anything ever before","I agree with sed59. Also, look up Debt-Free Degree. There may be some good ideas in ways to make money, get scholarships, and improve your situation. I worked 1-2 jobs throughout college and paid cash for it (no parental assistance....). It was a pain in the butt, but I made it work. Sometimes I couldn’t afford a full-time schedule, so I just signed up for what I could pay for. 

Sorry you’re going through this. I think you need to stick it out in your job until you find something different. Reach out to people (recruiters or others in your field) on linked in and see if they know of any positions you could apply for. "
3113,Heading back to toxicity,"Your unemployment benefits will end if you don't. Go back and try to find a better job? Then again, who am I to say..my employer is ending my lucrative but highly toxic job soon unless I go back to workahokism. Mo new job lined up. So burnt out I would like a break. "
3114,What do you do if you've just joined a company and your manager assigns someone to train /supervise you and that someone appears incompetent or seems like they are unwilling to help?,"Are there clear guidelines on what this other coworker is supposed to train you on? I also started another role during covid (literally the week that everything in our state began to shut down). I have been lucky that my supervisor is trying to train us ourselves, but she is pulled in many more directions right now. I was hired along with another coworker and we try to put our heads together to get through what we can and then collectively ask her together when we have questions or issues

I would go back to your supervisor, ask for a more clear list of what you need to know and learn, email your coworker with that list (cc your boss) and work from there. Lack of clarity can cause confusion and disparity in expectations. Another idea is to figure out if there may be another coworker who is more willing to mentor that might help you out instead. I have always had to seek out someone on my own as a work mentor during the first 6 months of a new job who I think is competent and willing to serve as a mentor. I have never had trouble finding one before. It may be that your boss made a bad assignment and is completely unaware. "
3115,Ghosted after receiving an offer and tentative start?,Have you called them and asked? 
3116,"Just got hired at a new full time job and keeping my part time job, but there is a conflict in schedules, don't know whether to bring this up to my new job.","You need to be honest, especially if the temp job puts you in contact with people who have the virus (thereby jeopardizing the health of the other employees in the office). I know here in the US, in my state you're asked to stay home from work for at least 10 days if you have been exposed. "
3117,Joining the same company as my girlfriend,"Look at the employee handbook when you start. If there is company policy about this then i would follow that.

3123,Remote Job requesting I send I9 over email,"You can put a password on PDF-Open.  If you want it to be more secure, put it on dropbox and share the file with them so they have to use HTTPS to get the file.

3124,Is it weird that HR/my supervisor hasn’t reached out to me about my internship ending?,"I had this happen to me twice as an intern (or was it a temp?). The first time it got to the morning of the last day and they let me know they were extending my contract. The next time I let it end as I knew they'd forgotten. I contacted them after via email to let them know I'd be leaving. They tried to extend again but I said no. I suppose it was a little unprofessional on both sides.

I don't think it's uncommon for it to happen but you're right - it doesn't exactly instil confidence. If you want to stay with them, or even if you don't, perhaps send an email to let them know when it's due to end and that you'd like to know what's happening. It's a simple request really. "
3125,Accepted job - drug test?,You should abstain for good. Sounds like you’re inviting unnecessary hassle to your life. 
3126,What happens if a employer posts a job that is not vacant,"I'm not sure, but the main task for you is to keep applying for more jobs until this one comes through (if it comes through at all). "
3127,Dismissed misdemeanor on background check?,"Upfront: I don’t know what does/doesn’t show up on background checks. For you, you’re not going to be able to know what is/isn’t a past act that eliminates a prospective hire. Just go for it, and if it comes up, stick with the truth always. 
My current job (a midsize regional bank) requested additional information on a DUI I received 3 years prior to the time of applying. Important note: I was upfront about this on my application. The HR onboarding person emailed me asking me to provide a written response confirming the conviction on the background check was accurate and any information surrounding it. I provided a very honest reply that adequately stated that this did occur, and my acceptance of responsibility, as well as any steps taken afterwards (MADD meetings, alcohol awareness meetings) and was very clear that this was not indicative of my character and personality. I didn’t go into details of the actual DUI, recounting the events, or anything like that, and certainly didn’t make any excuses. I didn’t fall on a sword or castigate myself unnecessarily, but I also didn’t try to shirk responsibility for my actions.
I still work at this job, and it’s never been brought up outside that first email from the HR onboarding person. "
3128,Laborer to Corporate Level,
3129,"At a new job, I have lots of downtime because people are too busy to train me, and am not sure what to do/how to stay productive",I had a job like that. There was no training because no one knew what I was supposed to do. I bought books on my field and read them on my phone at my desk. I made notes about improvements and contacts. I developed my own time sheets to show what I had been working on and to keep myself honest. I watched online videos from experts in my field. 
3130,Delayed start due to onboarding procedures - did I mess up?,"I’m in HR and our lab results have been SLOW. This sounds like a clinic mess up and isn’t on you. It happens sometimes, we just push the start date no biggie. Usually while I want 3 references, if I can get at least one good one I’m happy. 

Take a deep breath. It’ll be okay. Just stay in contact, provide information quickly when requested and you’ll be fine. "
3131,Will disclosing disabilities affect me in corporate?,
3132,How long into a new job until you feel like you are up to speed?,"You have never been the thing you are trying to be right now beforehand. When I got my new job last year, I was terrified for the first 6 months and just pushed my way through it. Always ask questions-- you won't be seen as incompetent or annoying, you will be seen as wanting to do your job right. Watch what other people who have your same job (or a job similar in responsibility to your own) do, ask why they do things a certain way when you are confused, and don't expect to get a whole process down in a day, a week, or a month. Give yourself time to learn. You will do great! They hired you over other people and know the potential you have. "

3141,How often should I continue to keep in contact with my recruiter 2 months before start date?,Ask.your recruiter. Seriously let them know you are nervous with hearing others stories and curious if you should check in periodically. I bet they will be open to discussing with you. They may even have a plan in place to contact you a certain times and maybe even concerned about bothering you to often. A quick conversation can clear it all up. :)

What advice could you give me to succeed?,"Make an extensive routine. Exercise, work, socializing, games, everything. And incorporate it into your life. Once you're set into it, feel free to mix and match, you'll be confident enough by then. Helped me not relapse for quite a while.

Ensure you find what makes you happy, or chuckle or just smile and keep it close. Mine is a playlist of jumpy songs I made😅 and a couple of screenshots of my partner being a dork via text😅 Have a contact you can bother and reach out to, in case you feel it slipping out of your fingers. Your partner, best friend, therapist, family, someone who can pull you back enough to let you take care of it yourself.

And don't be too hard on yourself. Yes, it's amazing work and you'll be amazing at it, but don't push too hard. :)

Good luck, mate. "

3147,Waited over 1/2 hour for a first day no show,"Once I showed up for a 7 am interview, at 6:40. Went to the front door and it was locked so went back to my car. Assumed i beat the office staff and waited until 6:55 only one car showed up and I wasnt for sure if the guy was my interviewer so I didnt try to make contact and follow him in. Went to the door a minute later, still locked...knocked on the door, tapped the glass.. nothing.  Decided at 7:02 to call the person who i was supposed to have the interview with. He was that guy, came to the door and had the gall to say I was late. He did end up offering me a position but then asked later that day if i would take a different role, calling it a floater (i was applying for a driver role) but really just trying to put me where he could fit me and said he would train me. I seriously didnt want to work shoulder to shoulder with anyone like that and rely on them to train me.  It was upsetting cause I just wanted a job, any job.. needed a job in a week or two or I wouldn't make rent. Things worked out in the end, cause I didnt take his offer. "
3148,"Impostor syndrome, or is it just that I’ve been misjudged in giving that job?","You will get it, don't beat yourself up! It sounds like your experience has just been a bit more administrative and this role is primarily strategic which will just take time to get used to. Even with a larger budget, I think the role sounds quite different from what you have done in the past, which is probably what excited you about it in the first place!

Are there other small universities that might have administrators with limited resources such as you are experiencing? Maybe you could connect over coffee; even if they feel they are equally lost as you feel it is someone you can bounce ideas off! I can imagine recruiting students to a university that is not prestigious or well known is quite challenging, but only a small percentage of schools are highly regarded so there must be some tactics all the other schools are using. No need to reinvent the wheel "
3149,"New job, business professional dress code?","With regard to your hair - you don't have to cut it.  You can wear it in a low ponytail, a bun, or a plain braid (just don't do the hair ties at regular intervals down the length like bikers do :P).  


They saw you were a dude with long hair and hired you all the same.  You can also wear it loose, as long as it's clean, and not straggly or in need of trimming. "
3150,How and when do you usually receive your schedule (retail)?,What's your dress code policy?? And the interview process? Just curious! 
3151,Starting a new job - advice please!,"A couple of top level thoughts.

\- Your boss is busy worrying about their own work. 

\- Make your boss's life easier.

\- If you don't understand what is being asked of you, ask for clarification.

\- If you have an issue with someone, talk to that person first.  Don't complain to others. 

\- Every day, write down a list of the most important things you need to do - it may be 2 or three things.   At the end of the day, review the list.   If you're not sure what should be on the list, review with your manager. 

\- Never talk disrespectfully about your manager to anyone at work. People talk to each other. 

\- Never put in writing something you don't want others to read. 

\- Learn, learn learn.  Take every training opportunity to learn more about your job, company, industry. That is how to get ahead.

\- Be present.  You're paid to be there, do that. It's half the battle.

Good luck "

I went through the same thing, took me a bit to start from signing my contact to my actual start date. Turns out HR was inundated with the amount of new hires and communication with me kind of just slipped. Really annoying, but I did start and the whole process took around 3 weeks. Don’t worry too much.  And after working here for a couple weeks I figured that HR is kind of incompetent, but my department is totally cool and fine. "

3179,Is there anyone who didn't pass their probation?,"You've been posting threads in various subreddits and deleting them afterwards for about a week now. I think you need a bit of a reality check. 

They hired you from another continent, that's the very first context you need to realise. Hiring like this is extremely expensive and risky for them, and does not happen usually except in cases one needs a specialist that can't be found locally. Even though Amazon is a global company it very much will want to keep hiring locally to the office you're meant to be at, because everything else is a logistical mess. So what this tells me is that you were meant to have some skill or background that was hard to get.

The fact that you kept bringing up lack of training and support doesn't chide well with the fact that you were hired for some specific skills you were meant to have. Yes there is usually a ramp-up period for newcomers, but generally this happens within the first month and by the third month one should already be working productively 80% of the time. 

Things blowing up and you going to HR complaining about lack of training could very well just seem that you were not possessing the skills that they expected you to have when they hired you. They expected somebody to come on board and be able to work productively, not still require training after several months. 

Over the ensuing threads you made and the panic you're in right now, it seems you hadn't fully realised this possibility and what exactly a probation period actually means. Especially in a European country like you're in right now, one does not consider a job to be secure until the probation period is over - it's one line of defence companies have against bad hires as past that it's extremely hard or very expensive to fire somebody without grave reason (Benefits you are getting is paid by the company).

Reclaiming relocation expenses and bonuses is standard practice in *any* company essentially anywhere. You will not find any job that gives out a bag of cash without having assurances they'll be keeping the hire for a long time and get a return on their investments. "
3180,Any info about Infosys Associate Position 2020 USA,"I don't work for infosys but I know people who have. How it's generally goes is they hire you, contract you out to another company (for example college board or Verizon, or w.e).

They bill Verizon like $50 an hour for your work, they pay you like $25-30, spend some amount on payroll tax and benefits (they do give PTO and normal benefit stuffs I think) and pocket the rest.

I'd avoid going through them unless you are certain you can't land a job directly, at say Verizon yourself.

On the plus side, if you're someone that are unable to step into the field this is an easy way in. After a year or 2 you have exp on your resume and job search become incredibly more easy.

All in all, it's not a scam, but it's not a super great job comparing to normal software developer job because they take a cut and benefits are general worse than the actual company (Verizon or w.e) benefits.

However for people that are working in minimum wage or retails and want to jump to a new career I suppose it's a way. 

Weight your options carefully "
3181,How to feel more comfortable at new job?,"I’m sorry you’re going through this OP. This can be very stressful and at times overwhelming I imagine. In a situation like this, you need both an emotional support and a practical solution. I suggest speaking to some close friends for support to see if they can give you a fresh perspective and to vent your feelings. In terms of a practical solution, a good place to start might be a confidential meeting with HR to discuss the issues and how you could proceed. Remember that HR cannot discuss your situation without your permission, so it would not hurt to try this to start with! "

3187,Very anxious about starting a new job Tuesday,"I’m in exactly the same situation. In the last year, I’ve experienced 2 super unexpected job losses and 2 very long seasons of unemployment before FINALLY being offered this job. Full time, incredible salary and benefits, great team, and a solid career move for me. I start one week from today, and I’ve had literal anxiety attacks about it. 

I can usually trust my gut about these things, but it’s so unreliable right now. My friend put it this way: “yeah, maybe you usually can trust your gut. But right now, after the year that you’ve had, your gut is recovering from the flu. You’re probably not gonna be able to trust it for a while.”

It’s like a conditioned response. If all you’ve known for so long is fear, anxiety, rejection, and job loss, you’re gonna be expecting those things, whether or not that’s actually what’s going to happen. Just acknowledge the anxiety and recognize where it’s coming from rather than trying to squash it or hide it away. And then remind yourself of what’s actually true: you did it! You found a great new job where you can add value and experience personal career growth. In a few months, you’ll have people you can call friends. You’re about to have stability again. You may not feel it for a while, (and that’s okay,) but you should be so proud of yourself!

Eventually, you’ll find some kind of equilibrium. I hope that you’re able to be gentle with yourself this week and find some kind of peace! "
3188,New Employee Onboarding before interview?,"Usually you would fill out all those forms after you've been hired, although generally your employment could be contingent on the results of a background check.

3198,How much notice should I give?,"Wait for the official offer letter, although you shouldn't worry too much. In a government hiring process, once you get past the background checks I don't think there's much that can derail you getting the job. There are strict hiring guidelines so you would not be subject to any management whims once you are the candidate selected. The only risk I can think of is if there were some way the position could lose funding in a dramatic and immediate fashion. 

If you have a good relationship with your boss or supervisor, I would let them in on it without officially giving notice. If you don't have a good relationship, it isn't likely you are going to use them as a reference anyway for 2 months work so not giving 2 weeks isn't going to ruin your reference. "
3199,Unsure if I should stay at this job?,">There are also times that my supervisors have not communicated necessary training information to me because they believe that another supervisor has already told me the necessary information and/or due to assuming I transferred within the company, I should already know the information (which is not possible due to differences in the departments).

Welcome to working with largely incompetent management and people who are happy to get a pay cheque for doing not very much all day.

If you actually do anything all it does is create problems, because their whole enviroment is a non-functional unproductive problem. 

The fact you are actually trying to do something in an efficient manner is odd to them.

I would discuss it with your own company, in a format of a time line of events, as at some point it will probably come back on you why you haven't got anything done, and having a chain of written documentation through email will be essential, ""having a chat"" won't stand up for anything in this situation it needs to be written documentation. Also updating them before hand on the situation will be useful saying that delays may occur due to prexisting projects taking priority (or whatever corporate BS you can come up with that isn't, ""no one is getting off their ass and doing any work""). 

I would see if you can get a list of outcomes that your clients senior management wants from your company, and has been sent to your company. Then work on implementing that, or if no one in that office can be bothered, sending the right emails to the right people, that would implement it if they could be bothered, to show that they had been asked to move forward but didn't respond with any actions. "
3222,I put my uncles' company on my resumé and my new job wants a W2 or paystub from it.,[deleted] 
3223,Randomly selected to NOT drug test??,"the higher up you are, the less they drug test you.  Sounds like you’re off the hook pre-employment but they likely reserve the right to test randomly/if they suspect you.

I would play it safe for the first 3-6 months and abstain from smoking until you get a feel for your team’s culture and schedule.  And always follow the golden rule:  trust no one.  Never confide in a colleague what your drug interests are *even if they confide in you first*.   Try to keep it gray, say you dabbled in college and leave it at that.  It’s often not the person you tell that is of concern but rather any third party that could blow the whistle by overhearing a convo or your trusted colleague gossiping.  I’ve smoked bud for 15 years but as far as my coworkers know I’m a patty plain Jane... 

Congrats on the new role! "
3224,Ghosted during onboarding?,"Subbed during the recession. You will get a call around 5 something in the morning when school starts. Since you are a sub, you are technically not an employee for the school district. There is no sick time, health insurance, or advantage when applying for longer term positions. So long as you had your background check and completed the training online, that is the max training you can expect. If the district offers you more, your training time will probably be unpaid. Keep looking! I would not work in any position at a school district that isn't represented by a union since there is a high risk of workplace assault and hours getting cut. "
3225,Tips on negotiation salary and benefits,
3226,Remote Job Startup,"Are you on contract or employed by them?

Typically if your employer is sending you a W-2 it is difficult to itemize deductions.  You should get them to pay for as much as possible because of this.  

If they are paying on a 1099 it is typically up to you to pay for all of those things, claim your expenses, and pay your taxes. "
3227,Company made me an offer but the background check company has terrible reviews,"People who don;t pass their background checks tend to leave ""negative reviews"".   I wouldn't pay this too much attention. "

3229,Got a job at a grocery store. Haven't been called and given training schedule/other info.,"This was there way of saying they no longer want you to work for them. Shit happens, call Panera and ask if they're still hiring and look around for jobs. "
3230,"Finally found a job, starting Monday.. but just realized I don't have two forms of ID. Will this bar me from starting?",You will have problems since they need to confirm that you can legally work in the US. HR will freak out. Maybe you can call your parents/relative to see if they have a copy of your birth certificate. Maybe you have scanned in a copy awhile back and you have it on your computer somewhere. 
3231,Currently being screened for 911 Operator. Need advice!,"as someone who reads dispatch reports, it helps to have decent typing skills (and spelling!) for clarity purposes and the record can be provided as part of the states evidence.

Just keep practicing and basically remember your home row keys of ASDF[space] JKL;[space] and that should get you into the habit of using the correct keys with the correct fingers. "
3232,Recently started a job in a newly-created role. I've been getting minimal guidance or training and I'm not sure what to do.,"First prioritize your projects, then write down a list of questions for each.  I assume you know how to do some of what you’re being asked or they wouldn’t have hired you.  Go to the person who assigned a given project and let them know you’re of course still learning the workflow but wanted to walk them through what you think the steps should be.  If Team A member jumps ahead and does something without you, ask them how they did it, say hey I would really love to take this part off your hands can you show me your process or here’s what I think your process was, does this work.  There are two types of people in your situation, those who quit because they dont know what to do and think there’s no training and those who figure out how to fill the holes, figure out how to slowly help each member of team A or  team B.  A lot of times companies have a group of employees that says they are really struggling to get something done and so they hire someone to do it, you, so if they won’t show you how to do it, try a few things, show them a few things, show your manager a few things, don’t ask or wait, just do.  The brilliance of a job like yours that isn’t standardized is you could make it what you want and then be the person everyone wants to go to and that person climbs quickly.  But also no harm if you think it’s too much to deal with and need more structure than that company provides. "
3233,"Accepted a job offer, but no start date yet.","As an aside, I would also start tossing resumes around and potentially taking on a few more interviews. Companies can be obnoxious and bail on you even after signing all the paperwork. "
3234,Surviving the first week in big tech as an introvert,What’s your job 
3235,Got an offer and now crickets....,"Background checks CAN take a long time (weeks, months), I would reach out to whomever sent you the offer and explain you haven't heard back about the background check and see if you're able to come in before that is completed or you will have to wait? "
3236,"After accepting the job offer, the company seems to ignore me. Should I be worried?","Once it's been like a week if they haven't sent ant further instructions, like for signing paperwork or anything like that, I'd follow up. Call if you have a number. 

This happened to me once. I accepted an offer and suddenly couldn't get into contact with the HR lady for like 3 days. It was really odd because she had been very responsive up until that point. I ended up getting frustrated and decided to move on and ended up taking a worse offer. As soon as I emailed to tell her that, she responded saying sonething like sorry it didn't work out. So I figured they couldn't wait a day for me to respond (I was always at work every other time they called). They called me a month later to try offering me a much better position and it's took bad I'd given up in the whole area and was already planning a move out of state. 

Long story short, follow up a few times. Don't rush to move on but also keep looking in case it falls through. "
3237,"Has anyone here ever landed a desirable job by accident or just by being in the right place at the right time? If so, what happened, and how did it turn out?","My first job I got literally by walking down a hall at the right time while I was in college--they needed somebody ASAP to replace someone who'd failed to even properly quit (just failed to turn up), they knew I had the qualifications, all they needed to know was that I was available and willing.

&#x200B;

Kept that job for several years, before I had to quit because of obligations elsewhere. "
3238,How to handle being on-call overnight for new job?,"We are a 24/7 society now and many jobs require ""on-call"".  I am on-call every 4 to 6 weeks.  Sometimes I am the primary and sometimes I am the backup.

Its just important that you cancel all your other activities, shop for food early, do the laundry, etc., before you are on-call.   Its important that you carefully document all ""incidents"" because you don't want to keep fixing the same problems over and over again. "
3239,Preemployment drug test for nicotine,"If they're testing for it, I imagine that means no job if you fail.

3240,My boss is a lunatic - she’s been contracting herself every other day.,"I usually give jobs 90 days to decide if its a Go/No Go situation.  I have had enough jobs/experience now to know when something just isn't going to work out.

I once started a job with a woman who hired me as the SME and  was confrontational, impulsive, forgetful and on and on.  After about 90 days, I put in my two-week notice and during my last few days, I heard ""You know, Karen is Bi-Polar right?""  LOL!   Apparently, the staff knew about her medical condition but just tiptoed around her. "
3241,Is poor job training pretty common now?,"I don't think it's super all that different. Learn from doing, learn on the job. Job experience is 10 times more relevant in the long run than training....

that being said if you want to succeed always be learning. that's really on you. no matter what field you are in, keep learning \-

honest most jobs that need skills early\-on, these are mostly transferable skills \- if you can learn one job, you can learn another just as fast if not faster. Ask the right questions, don't spam questions, if you have to ask more than once that's on you. Take notes, review what you learn regularly \- after work, recall what happened and what you learned from it. or if you can do that twice or four times throughout the day, even better. shouldn't even take five minutes to do.

If your jobs aren't training you, then you need to take that responsibility for yourself \- that's just the way it goes really \- gotta do the work that makes you worth something heh \- if you don't take care of your responsibilities, what are you really worth at all?

3247,"I accepted a job I don't know if I'm 100% qualified for. Besides working my ass off, what should I focus on?","If you get the job then you are qualified.

I got some on the job training but even after that I didn't know as much as the other people on the team.  Most of the people on the team had degrees in CS but I had only a GED at the time.  But you know what I stuck it out and I even managed to get promoted.  Unfortunately due to racism this made the local Chinese jealous that a non-Chinese person got promoted and they conspired to get me fired.  My next job was as a translator.  I don't speak Chinese and still don't.

From memory you're gonna need work history, with every gap filled (Have friends/family to vet unemployment periods) and contact information for your manager, every place you have lived in that time period, as well as a few character references that don't appear anywhere else in the form. 

Also most importantly; DO NOT LIE. There will be a question on if you have done drugs or not for instance, answer it truthfully. It is a felony to intentionally falsify information on that form. "

My only advice is don't be afraid to keep asking for work, and make it known you're willing to work. 

IF you want to look for new jobs, you'd at least have a good reason to give for looking around so early.

When I had this free time, I looked into how our database systems worked and learned some SQL. you didn't specify your specific work so I don't know if doing like this is possible for you or if there even is work you can just pick up. 

In retrospect the only thing I wish I'd done in the past was voice my concerns of not having work to do. I think it could have relieved some of the paranoia you're talking about and don't think it would have hurt at all to do. "

Subtracting bills and rent etc (say $400)

Then divide by 30 to get your daily expenses (600/30 = 20)

So basically you have $20 each day to spend on your shit. So when you are spending money, you know that you shouldn't go past ~$140 a week. And each day you might want to spend around $10 on food, so you have extra to spend on weekends. "

>Logistics-I don't have a routine yet, and it's stressing me out. I don't wake up at a set time, or know when I can leave work.

Get this down as soon as you can. Preparing for bed, Sleeping, Waking and leaving should be the same time every single day. It doesn't matter when, but the time shouldn't change. I set a 'preparing for bed' alarm every day because I am bad at keeping sleep schedules. Make sure you get ~8 hours every night.

Ask your boss about time expectations.

>Downtime-I overbooked myself and was out every night this week until 10/11, but I'm nervous I won't be able to make time to see friends and workout.

I would never work somewhere with this policy. The police don't get to search my stuff without a warrant, neither does my boss. 

>Writeups for foul language. (In a kitchen setting? Are they serious?)

That one is fair. It's better to have a no foul language rule and not enforce it, than not have a rule and then have to deal with foul-mouthed staff offending customers and arguing that it's their right since it's not in the handbook. Not to mention it can be off-putting and uncomfortable for some other employees, especially if it's mostly men being foul about sex, or vice versa. 

>Regulations against drinking alcohol when off duty.

If they are saying you can't drink ever, that's unreasonable. I wouldn't work somewhere that dictated how I live when I'm off the clock. If they're saying you can't drink at that restaurant ever, or you can't drink in uniform, that's a pretty common policy. "

I've been homeless, some of the people you will be interacting with have serious problems, you shouldn't be alone. Of course you should be concerned about your safety. It's not like you are walking around a wealthy HOA where everybody is well-off and busy with their lives. And they lied about training. 

Super not cool that you are having to do something where you aren't even allowed to be in there. Residents are probably even instructed not to let random strangers in, you might even get them in trouble. And since the organizer didn't answer your question, the answer is likely yes, at least with having the cops called. I don't know what the law is, but you may even be breaking trespassing laws considering you are sneaking in behind residents. And then if you are charged with that, then you have that to possibly deal with when you are applying to another job. 

I know how much it sucks to go that long without a job, but that's how absolutely awful jobs that might not even be doing legal things rope people in.

A lot of recent graduates complain about tech support jobs, but depending on the environment (where tech support sometimes becomes borderline applications support/software development) that experience can shoot you into the division you want to be working for. A friend of mine who was tech support for a hospital was able to use the cross-job skills he acquired there to get a software development position at a different company. Cross-job skills are important for new graduates and to not emphasize them on cover letters/resumes/CVs is terrible.

Most of us are at one of these two stages:

>1988 $11,340 Unemployment, temp jobs, depression
1989 $23,308 Moved to city I didn't want to live in, but grateful for the opportunity.

Did you want to be patronized or talked to like a child when you were depressed? I've studied in four cities in three countries, and I did an internship at a factory in China.

I'm now in Europe and almost all large companies now want to enter the Chinese market. Sounds great, right? The problem is that it is impossible to get in touch with them. The only time I've heard back it's been ""we'll be in touch"" or ""you don't have enough experience."" Certainly there must be plenty of people who'd want to hire me (I have a STEM/business dual degree too), I just can't get in touch with them or find out where they are. I make my CV and cover letter as a website and send it to companies on Twitter in response when they announce job openings but they don't even look at it.

If you're really in business and have a somewhat senior position you should educate yourself about how the economy works and how a digital business works.

First of all, we are in a global recession due to completely mismanaged monetary policy, which results in money flowing to the top - away from production, manufacturing and entry-level jobs which are cut or replaced with internships, to finance and venture capital who in turn invest in Silicon Valley startups. THIS is why WhatsApp is ""worth"" 19B.

The secondary consequence of this is an environment where labor is abundant while jobs are scarce, meaning employers pay very little and offer no security and won't train employees as that is also a cost. Since nobody wants to train, it is close to impossible to gain experience and skills needed to get a job.

I'm always entertained by these ""here are some pretty typical things that are wrong to do"", because they often reveal the personal biases of the writer rather than tackling the (perceived) data deficiency issue that plagues the market. Complete with ""buy my stuff"" in the margins.

As hiring professionals, we always read applications that aren't perfect. It happens, and it can be silly or become a fun anecdote. But, we don't use those hiccups to make judgments about our candidates and their qualifications. Doing so leads to a slippery road of zero tolerance over the most trivial matter (using plain copy paper instead of heavy card stock for your resume, are you desperately trying to show that you're not interested?!). I wish people who are taking hiring serious, AS THEIR JOB, could look in the mirror and evaluate their own processes first, before pointing the finger at applicants for not doing enough or assuming they are making ""common"" mistakes.

The reason people on this thread tell people to take the dream job, or even a better job after a short time, is because a lot of us (myself included) have been thrown out with the trash at a company despite stellar performance and great relations with coworkers and supervisors.  Some bean-counter somewhere saw my position and how much I was paid and crossed it off the ledger, and that was that.

It doesn't matter what company you work for, doesn't matter how cool and understanding your boss or CEO is, doesn't matter how long they've been in business, doesn't matter how long you've worked there or how hard you've worked or how successful you've been in your position:  your company doesn't give a *shit* about you.  They will fire you/lay you off/make up some reason to get rid of you if they have to.

3406,Passion vs Personality,"For me, personality is more important. I love linguistics and everyone tells me I should go to grad school to become a linguistics professor.

I would be way too stressed out by the cutthroat competitiveness of the job market and the cultural expectation in academia that you should always either be working or feeling guilty about not working. I hate confrontation and academia is a confrontational culture. I really don't like writing long papers and do not want to write a dissertation. 

Instead, I have a job in a field that interests me but isn't the thing I love most in the world. It's a great personality fit -- lots of hanging out on my own doing my thing, very little talking to people, a good balance of hard enough to be intellectually stimulating but not hard enough to be extremely or constantly stressful.

Inversely, the author also hasn't established why Angelic Weakness can tell ""who they are"". All we know is that he just likes to hire people who play along, and answer the question based on some (not most or all) people's interpretation of this question. 

I did like how he attempted to deter faked responses by establishing the nature of the assessment from the start. The wording, if that's how he actually presents it, was still a bit crude - it still conveys the notion that he's just added another layer of deception to the game. It's actually more effective to just administer questions/problems that can be measured objectively, tell his candidates to follow the guided directions, and to respond honestly (which has shown to reduce faking in job applicants).

3412,How to screw up your job search,"In terms of #10...

I had a friend apply for a job opening at my current place of employment.

This advice actually lost her an in-person interview.  She was telephone screened by my boss but HR recommended to not go further with her because she wouldn't tell them her salary history... they thought she was being 'dodgy' about her past history by not telling them.

In my experience it's better to tell.  If you're applying for something well above what you currently make, it's better to say what you do make and then explain that you did your research and know you're underpaid for the value you bring to the company via the job you do.  It's what I did and I up'd my salary by over 35k using this tactic when going from one job to another. "

I want to give you the information you need to make a decision. Not once have I made a hiring decision based on someone asking 'the right questions.' Questions will make you seem more interested, but it will always come down to your skills and experience being the best fit for the position. 

The top 5 questions you should ask are whatever is important to you. Is it benefits? Time off? Pay? Your boss? Working hours? What is it that's important to you? Be sure you're interviewing at a place you want to stay, and ask those questions that will make or break you accepting an offer. 

Otherwise, don't ask questions. Mention that they answered all of your questions, specify what they were, and end the interview. I won't ask any questions that I don't need to make a decision, so please respect my time and only ask what you really want to know.  "

This article shares the view with a very small minority in the field, which I wouldn't say I'm a part of. Now, I admit that some of those things you mentioned would annoy me also, but I certainly wouldn't use those criteria to assess potential candidates. So maybe you can clear up a few things here:

1. I see that you'll look at Facebook profiles as well. While it barely makes sense on a colloquial level, recent research has just started to investigate its validity compared to FFM, with weak and mixed results. So without having a solid foundation of what to look for, and with the limited time and resources, why is looking at social media website an assessment criteria in this case?

2. Looking for smiles, a certain way of dressing, how friendly/polite they approach you seem to serve the purpose of making *you* feel special. This sounds like a form of impression management, the dangers of which I am sure you are familiar with. Perhaps you can further explain how these trivial physical behaviors can account for variances in job performance/satisfaction/needs of the organization? If I'm a job fair attendee, I'm going to focus on seeking out the companies more than cracking a smile. After a long day at the fair, I'm going to have a lot of pamphlets and documents and brochures to lug around. If I see that the booth is empty, I'm going to stay for more than two minutes to really have a conversation with the recruiter. Are you saying that even though I'm qualified for the job (KSAs, competencies, and organizational fit), you would not consider me if I perform these actions?

3. If the purpose of the job fair is to connect potential applicants with the organization, and for the organization to show a presence for applicants to consider, why is there such a strict list of criteria on whether or not they are *allowed* to further explore the company with us? From the way it was written, it sounds like we all have a checklist to mark off when someone comes to talk to us; and if they don't meet enough of our criteria, they can't work at the company. Even you said it yourself, it seems like it's more of a game than trying to make honest connections with potential applicants. "

3445,Should I trust my gut feeling and discard this job opportunity?,how'd you decide in the end? 
3446,I just got a job and would like to give back.,Thanks for this. I should work harder. 
3447,Reminder: Remember to check out your employer's website or know what they do before your interview,"What DOES your employer ""do""? Are we talking about personal accomplishments of the President and CEOs? The latest restructuring campaign that catapulted the company to brand recognition? The type of software that your employer specifically develops, but vehemently ignores certain other types of programming that are commonly used in the industry?

And how does that connect to the current need of that organization right now? How will your candidates individually benefit from understanding those information, in terms of future job performance for that particular position?...If job performance is even an issue that is driving the hiring right now.

It's easy to say that this is ""Interview 101"", but I rarely hear job-fillers say ""I need candidates to understand how Recent Event ABC has impacted our need to look for workers with Attribute XYZ, because having those would significantly impact the company in meeting its goals."" As if since lots of interviewers are asking this question, it automatically means that it's a valid assessment to determine qualification.

Unfortunately, it's usually ""You need to look up anything you can about our company. And if you don't know those trivia, *that says something about you*"", with ""that"" being something along the lines of incompetence.

How can employers miss this? Understanding high assessment fidelity is basic Employment Selection 101. "

For a lot of these people, there is no real passion there. They're all there because they feel obligated as part of their profession. Clock in, clock out. After hours.

I've joined more hobby based clubs or activity based organizations and I've connected with more people as opposed to just being added as #1800 on their rolodex or LinkedIn. But you need to take the time to get to know people and eventually they will reveal what they do and maybe your paths can cross. But you're in a better mind set and it's about meeting more people as opposed to seeking opportunities.

It's really more practical for the *employers* to understand that if they are asking questions that are vague, tricky, or won't receive the data it's asking for, they have to go back to the drawing board and rephrase the question, at the very least. To structure all these rules and teach job seekers about changing their perspectives to ""properly"" approach this question, gives the impression that employers are allowed to introduce any flawed methodology they feel like using.

3483,What to Expect When Going Through the Technical Interview,"Google has actually [recanted a lot of the boasting about their off-the-wall hiring methods](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&), finding out that a lot of the factors they thought were important, [actually wasn't](http://dailycaller.com/2013/06/20/google-executive-gpa-test-scores-worthless-for-hiring/). From that, they learned a [list of takeaways](http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130620142512-35894743-on-gpas-and-brain-teasers-new-insights-from-google-on-recruiting-and-hiring) to improve their hiring process in the future. Even before this revelation, Google was able to get away with this method because they defined what they want to look for really well AND THEN created a workplace environment that support those types of workers. You don't see this in a lot of companies that want to copy this technique, which is what makes it so dangerous.

There were some other discrepancies that popped up while I was reading that entry, but I will reduce this wall of text down to one pressing question referring to this statement:

>Obviously I can’t cover all the facets of a technical interview, especially because these interviews can vary tremendously from one specialty to another and from one industry to another. For example, an interview for a web developer’s position will be quite different from an interview for a help desk position.

As a trained hiring professional, I would agree that a Web Developer is certainly a very different position from Help Desk. However, I also know that they still share a lot of core job competencies that allow them to function and maneuver between those jobs, so the way to *hire* them is not all that different. I wonder, IF two jobs are so irrelevant even within its own field, why would people even want to attempt to give out advice in generality? Knowing that whatever is written can only be applied to this one instance for one position.

I hope you don't take it as an offense to what you're trying to accomplish, but I have not found the answer to this day when all of us are seeing this surge of people who want to give advice because they have held a lot of interviews. I've seen ""job gurus"" who want to charge money for this service, which makes it all the more hypocritical. "

The scope of the writing is still too narrowly focused on the applicants, and almost none on the employer. Sure, as an applicant, I shouldn't drone endlessly or use vague buzzwords.

We can also apply this list to how *interviewers* can make or break the interview they designed, since I've seen job-fillers violate almost every single thing on that list.

3515,"Does Amazon drug test their IT staff/white collar workers regularly, or just at hire?","Depends on the state, whether the position is considered safety sensitive, whether the position falls under DOT regulation, and of course on Amazon's own policies. For positions not covered by DOT or safety sensitive requirements, most employers drug test during the pre-employment phase and for reasonable suspicion. If you fall under DOT (IT work does not), random testing protocols are required. Some employers test if you change jobs within the same company. Not many employers test periodically. Periodic testing is prohibited in some states. Cannabis testing rules for employment are in flux, with a slow but steady national trend toward increased restrictions. Google pre-employment drug testing requirements by state to find current status. See if you can find a copy of Amazon's policy. You will see state laws vary between no testing allowed, to test whenever you want, to test following federal guidelines. If you are in New York, you will be pleased to know Cannabis testing for pre-employment was recently banned. Best of luck. "

3) grind. Make a target of cold calling say 100 businesses a day. Ask to talk to the CEO or a GM or Purchaser. Cold calling scripts can be found on r/sales and some are pretty good  

4) prospect. Ask a bunch of questions with the intent of countering objections you may get later on. For instance: whats the need for you? Say im selling you a gym pass your need may be to lose or gain weight, fix your bad back, heart health, etc... ask about the price range they expect, timeline to close the deal, etc... if they object highlight how your product meets these answers and then try to close. 

5) close deals. Ask for the sale. I personally like the optional close: you want this red pen or blue pen? For your needs I recommend the blue pen. What do you say?"" When they pick blue or red, just assume the close and grab the paperwork. If they object repeat step 4.

Most companies I see charge a rate per month which is based on content creation (e.g. number of posts). Handling more accounts = more work so set your charge to reflect that. See if you can find some local companies that provide this service and see what they charge. "
3549,President of company publicly posting about future flipping of company. Faux pas?,"certainly seems like a faux pas to me, but do you have another question?  i can see you being concerned about your future as a result (if you are), but whether it's a faux pas or not doesn't really impact anything, other than the fact that now you know your president's plans (whether or not they come to fruition) and that he doesn't understand the difference between his inside voice and his outside voice.

3550,How to handle conversations about former toxic workplace?,"I’d just be honest. You’d feel so badly if you sugarcoated it, and they starting working there.

>hard work, long hours, and self sacrifice to make it

Wut?

Typically, industries in which people work 12 hour days are pretty fast-paced, so this doesn't add up. You don't want to work in a place that expects your soul in exchange for a paycheck, yet is indecisive enough to waste a year of your time *just for the hiring process*. That's the worst of both worlds.

ETA: Wait, so your boss ""makes jokes"" about things that reasonable people might see as a VERY serious topic? Fuck that. "
3553,Why is my company “suggesting” us to take a day off on Easter Monday?,">Does anyone understand this at all? I am super confused on the reasoning but there seems to be a an underlying business strategy they are doing to protect the company? Someone please explain! :/

Banked vacation time is a liability on the balance sheet. If all of the employees at the company take a vacation day it will decrease the liability by a significant amount. Think of what you get paid in a day. Think of what everyone in the company gets paid for a day. The total accrued vacation liability falls by the total amount of what everyone gets paid for that day.

On an overall level that will make the company much stronger financially. That will make it easier for your company to get financing or to get better rates on their financing.  

It's a really small individual sacrifice. Taking a vacation day when you hadn't planned to. 

If everyone works together you will really be doing a good thing for your company. 

Yes, I am a CPA. "
3554,New job isn't going great,This seems like they made the changes for very specific reasons that they haven't made anyone aware of. To me it sounds like they are trying to downsize the sales team by having them basically fight it out and at the same time generating revenue. I would start looking for another job because I don't think this is going to end well for a number of you. 
3555,"Employer is very interested in me, but has a hiring freeze until mid Feb. What does this mean and what should I do?","Kinda on the same boat as you, but they didn't give me a date of when they'd open up again. Did you ever hear back from them? "
3556,Why do companies keep job postings open for so long?,"As a hiring official, I have to tell you if I had a dollar for every time I had a “strong candidate” that didn’t make through the whole process I’d be a very rich man. 

I usually won’t stop first round interviews until I have at least 3 good prospects.  Then there is the technical testing, background and reference checks as well as two more rounds of interviews. 

The job posting doesn’t get closed out until a candidate accepts an offer. "
3557,How would you feel if your current job tracks and records every mistake you make?,"Don’t most companies do this?  I don’t know too many companies that would just sweep mistakes under the rug lol.  Ours are tracked and we get a quality rating on our performance review.  I know that if we make too many, like 10 or so in a rolling calendar year we can get written up and subject to other action, but I’ve worked at my job for almost 15 years and have never come close to that. "
3558,Should I work with Aerotek?,"Aerotek is a typical staffing agency. Most people who work with them don't realize this and are upset when they find out they aren't a traditional, full-time employer. They are there to help companies fill open spots. If you land a job through them, just make sure you know what's included and what's not as far as pay, benefits, time off, etc. "
3559,Do most people who go into warehouse start on night shift?,"Nothing to do with seniority. Warehouse jobs tend to be nightshift though because the work they accomplish is one of the first things in the supply chain. For example, stockers that generally stock in the day time need to have the freight already unloaded and sorted. "

3562,Are 2020 Census jobs worth applying for?,"It’s a temp position that pays $15/hr for you to drive around and go door to door and fill out surveys for people.

The down side is that you will end up going to sketchy houses and having to interact with sketchy people or people with attacks dogs or property that is a hazard to cross. SO BEWARE! 

If you’re young and have no job experience take it but watch out for sketchy houses and just report those houses as survey unobtainable and pass those to someone else. 

If you have experience and other schooling or skills look for something better than this. "

3566,What should I actively be doing in my job to ensure I keep it?,"If your direct supervisor gave you good praise, it could be that you were let go for other reasons but the pinned it on your work ability (could be a lie). If that’s the case that company sucks and you should be glad to be out!

For your current job, continue doing your best. Ask your direct supervisor and team mates for feedback. Constantly ask them how you can help make their day easier. Ask questions. Sit in on meetings, take notes, and send them out. Continue asking for feedback and how you can improve, and even ask what you’re doing good on so you know what your strengths are. Be proactive where you can. Set up 1 on 1s with your direct supervisor if time allows. Use this time to discuss workload, get direction, a quick performance review, etc.

Personally I always try to appease whoever is able to fire me or give me a raise. Those are the people I answer to the quickest but it’s also important to be a team player as they can contribute to whether or not you stay. 

Good luck! "
3567,HR says I can't return because I didn't submit my timesheets,"Or she just thinks that it was a constant pain in the ass to not have the paperwork they required or that it could open up a liability with the client.

3572,Odd job listings in Chicago?,Glad to know I'm not the only one. I applied for administrative work and it seems I can't find anything on this company other than their smoke and mirror website.

When I told them I couldn't as it was the core time I absolutely have to be at my current job (only myself and my manager are trained how to do it) they gave me an 11:45 time and confirmed it without asking me. It doesn't seem legit.

3574,What are ways to identify toxic work environments ahead of time? Dealing with a toxic work environment right now...,"My previous job was a federal government position and it was an awful place. The local area and my direct manager were terrible. My fault I didn’t know this ahead of time because it was a direct hire position so I didn’t interview. Just applied and provided references (that the manager did call) and was offered the position. Glassdoor/Indeed weren’t really helpful. 

I reached out to HR about meeting the manager before accepting and HR told me that they didn’t recommend doing that. Stupid me didn’t push it and accepted the offer. I left eight months later. "
3575,Question about calling in absent,[deleted] 
3576,Liberty National,"I'd recommend checking out their Glassdoor profile for employee reviews. I'm currently job hunting and have gotten some cold calls from their recruiters about being hired and have avoided it, largely because I'm not looking for the type of job they describe.

That being said, I think it's a legitimate business and everything. Be wary if they want you to invest any of your own money into training or similar. Also, make sure you understand your employment in terms of if your an independent contractor or have a W-2, could cause big issues for you come tax season if you realize they haven't been taking out taxes on your paycheck. I would imagine at this point  you know more than me, but it seems to be one of those jobs that involve a lot of cold-calling and are commission-based. Not impossible to make money, but doesn't seem easy. "
3577,Why do so many companies ghost you after applying?,"It's called bad manners. Unless they had hundreds or thousands of applicants (and/or they are still interviewing) a response, or feedback, should always be given. It's simple courtesy. "
3578,Any recommendations for interviewing with a startup?,"In my experience of working for startups (3 so far), the one thing that I’ve learned the hard way is potential lack of benefits. The healthcare benefits can be bad, if they’re cheap and if they’re fewer than 50 employees they are under no obligation to follow FMLA. 

One company terminated my medical insurance two days after we parted ways so I was unable to continue with COBRA. But on the other hand, I was given fully paid maternity leave by another startup. "
3579,Best Corporate jobs with full benefits - medical especially .. (in the USA),"🤣

3581,"I'm at a great place now, but scared.","You hit close to the target when you asked if you're a threat to your fellow employees. You're actually a threat to those in charge. What they see in you is you can take their place. It's their fear you're seeing over and over again.

Fellow employees who don't like you ... they know they can't measure up or don't even want to bother having to put out that type of effort so it's an auto-distaste. They just want you to go away because you make them look bad.

3582,How does the “training period” work within the US ?,"Most companies have a 90 day introductory phase, but those are generally used as performance marks. You’re far more likely to, at the least, get a few days of actual “training” on the job to get used to the work flow and responsibilities. "
3583,Why are people expected to work their way up in corporate jobs?,"It is connected to the expectation by investors and stock markets that your company will grow relentlessly. Growth is what stock market rewards, not pure profits or even pure performance. 

As a result, your bosses assume your team will continue to grow over the next several years (not stay steady in size). So they expect you to grow with the company and with the company's team size. "

3588,Nervous about the company being taken over?,"There’s no real way to be sure.  And the people telling you your job is safe probably believe it is, but also don’t know for sure.  Continue to make yourself essentially and casually look elsewhere as well.  Also look at the signs yourself, if the company taking it over in the same business, do they do the same things? Do they already have a department that does what you do? "
3589,What companies have the best employee perks?,"Working in entertainment means loads of free events - concerts, movie screenings, festivals. Loads of free CDs and DVDs (occasionally vinyl), free tshirts, free posters, stickers, and coffee mugs with a band's logo on them. Maybe not as glamorous a perk as free flights, but getting into concerts for free is pretty cool. "
3590,Is preHIRED legit?,"I'm here to see who has experience with this.

He even moved from Florida to South Carolina to be closer to this ""job"", which is the whole reason why we met (he's subleasing my apartment until May). 

SL is currently freaking out right now about the trainer getting fired. He seems to think that they will let him go in the process. I'm explained to him that this is the company's issue and that they will just find a replacement to train him. He then reveals to me that this company has only 5 people. I am now skeptical about this software sales ""company"" and preHIRED. I previously raised my eyebrow when SL told me that his main boss lives in North Carolina, while his Team Leader lives in South Carolina, so that is why he moved to South Carolina from Florida.

3603,Why do companies use staffing agencies to hire permanent full-time workers?,"Some people are making it sound like it's nearly impossible for companies to do hiring sometimes.

The reality is that Employee Selection is a critical part of organizational development, so it doesn't make sense for a company to not have the wherewithal to handle it, or believe they will always do it badly. It's like avid marathon runners outsourcing their shoe-tying to somebody else, because they don't have the time to do it themselves or believe they wouldn't tie a knot well. If they want to run, this is one of the basic things they need to do.

The problem is that companies didn't equip themselves with an HR that contained knowledgeable professionals who were trained to do hiring. Selection is totally a part of HR's wheelhouse, but most of the field is still comprised of old guards who got the position by being nice and know how to handle a payroll spreadsheet; and they gatekeep professionals from entering through arbitrary networking tactics. Companies could've easily onboarded someone with an HRM or related degrees, maybe certified, but definitely have expertise in organizational development; but they are stymied by the current HR Manager/Generalists who believe they won't be able to do the job effectively because reasons.

At the very least, the company doesn't have executive leadership that are well-versed enough about this. So they have no idea any of this is happening. Then, the only conclusion is to outsource their recruitment and selection efforts to third-party vendors like Staffing Agencies and Recruitment Firms, believing they are getting a 1:1 replacement with a talent acquisition professional. Like many comments have mentioned, these companies are ironically bleeding money because these firms aren't using sound methodologies to hire effectively, and they're sacrificing an already limited budget or competitive compensation because these agencies need to take their cut from somewhere.

3609,When did companies get so stingy?,"let me guess.  you don't get benefits.

If this is the case, your employer probably asked you to 'watch it' lest you get crazy, pull an extra five hours a pay period here and there, and then they're required to kick down some bennies.

I doubt it's a matter of them not wanting to pay you 15 minutes over, so much as they're wanting to avoid you eventually triggering benefits.  this is especially a possibility when you say ""fortune 500 company,"" indicating they are beholden to federal laws with respect to when benefits kick in. "
3610,Advice about CADC LLC,I loved working for the company! Can't wait till they come back to Oklahoma. I'm sure that some of the negative comments were due to poor management in that particular office because each office in every state has a different canvass supervisor. CADC probably already fired whichever canvass supervisor that caused those negative reviews because from personal experience they're very good about hiring the right kind of people and firing the ones who don't have any place in politics or don't have the ability to treat people the right way.

Loyalty is earned my friend. If a company or small business treats you well, Pays you what you are worth and makes an effort to make their employees lives even a little bit better then you can place your loyalty not in the company but in those around you. If your boss is a great guy, Gives you all the opportunity he can provide, Understands day to day problems that sometimes require absence from work and so on. Then you can place your loyalty in him.

Companies are not built for employees happiness. They are built to exploit people for profit. This model has worked well over time but at the cost of quality of life.

Being so young I would give this advice I give every youngster. Speaking from experience. I hate my work life and am actively trying to replace it. I just wish i realised all these things sooner.

* If you working harder than what you are being paid for. You are losing money.
* If you feel like you are being exploited then you probably are.
* Working harder than those around you won't do you many favours in the long run.
* Work requiring low skill or just an able body is never rewarded well.
* Loyalty placed in companies is misplaced
* If there is little room to move up the chain, Don't exert more energy than needed.
* You will always hate your job after a while and dread coming into work.
* Use your free time wisely, Don't waste your youth working 40 hour weeks for little reward
* Retail is a horrible industry
* Ask for a pay rise when you want it. Don't be a pushover, More money does not come without asking.
* Working diligently to make someone else more money that they pay you is an exercise in futility and should be limited.
* Look at starting a business.
* Picking a career immediately puts a hard cap on your potential earnings. You will only ever be paid so much.
* Business has a no real cap on potential earnings.
* Depending on your personality type you may find structured organisations relentless and disheartening.
* Anyone who tells you they enjoy their job and isn't a marine biologist or doing some other cool shit is lying to you and themselves.
* There are better jobs out there. None of witch will fulfil you, most of them are horrible grinds design to squeeze the life out of you.
* Don't take your boss to seriously.

Advice from an IT manager. But I am also a fucking retard. You will encounter people like me often.

I have interviewed kids for service desk and dev ops roles, I can see they are eager and keen, It breaks my heart when after hiring one they become a drone right in front of my eyes.

&#x200B;

Start a business mate, Don't end up like the rest of us.

If someone says they like their mediocre job. They are lying and want you to experience the same pain they are.

Did I forget to mention, the higher you are paid the worse life gets and the less time you have? This is the rule for employment, There are exceptions but you are not likely to be one of them. Higher pay does not mean better quality of life. I know from experience. Being on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week is not worth the money.

Start a business. Its not easy but its not harder than people make it out to be. "

And do you use any kind of gateway to access a workplace network/shared files drive? Go to your Programs area and Google any software you are not familiar with.  If you are just using Wi-Fi, then they can only see your browsing history and cannot see your files.  If you use any kind of VPN or a Citrix login, oh yeah they are watching you. If it's your own device and they joined you to the network, they can see your browsing history while you are using their internet **and** copy data from your local computer back to their storage. So if you are bringing your personal laptop , your personal files are not secure. 

Most companies I know of do not actually use tracking software: they manage permissions from  the hardware firewall (blocking Facebook or 18+ websites), disabling the admin rights to access storage drives or to save files. The firewall itself is the monitoring device and it keeps a log of websites visited amongst other things. So you aren't likely to have your HR team bust down the door while one is actually  watching Pornhub, they review the logs and pull you into a meeting 24-48 hrs later.... I hope that helps.

3623,I despise Open Concept offices,(Cross posted to /r/OfficeWorkers) 
3624,Shared “confidential” information with VP of a department at my job for him to present at a company meeting. Am I overthinking?,"In general, I say No to anyone who wants to ""share something in confidence"" with me. "
3625,Was put on a performance improvement plan sometime last year by a manager whom I could not get along with.,"Maybe?  

As a manager I put four people on PiPs in 2017.  Of those 4, one left of his own accord a month after the PiP started, one was promoted outside of my department, one hung on through the PiP and was then fired, and the 4th ended up taking my manager position when I moved on.  

So YMMV.  A lot of folks see them as a documentable track toward firing, but that's not always the case. "
3626,Mechanical engineering for KeyW/Jacob's. What do you guys think of the place?,"KeyW is a competitor of ours. They are an acquisition of an acquisition so I’m not sure how much of the original talent is still there under Jacobs but they’re a respected defense contractor and a common name in the industry. The name looks good on a resume.

Is Jacobs trying to pivot to R&D? That’s probably what I’d ask about in an interview; how has the Jacob’s acquisition affected KeyW reinvestment into IR&D, are there any changes to benefits coming, is the corporate culture an R&D culture or a contract services culture, stuff like that. You don’t want to be an R&D engineer in a contract services company, but if this is Jacobs pivoting towards higher margin R&D and products then that’s different. "
3627,Farmers insurance keeps emailing me. What’s it like working there or similar.,"Would you work a job you didn't like because they were persistent in automated emails?  

If you're considering getting into insurance, that's one thing -- but if you're thinking about taking a job because they email you a lot, that's probably not going to end well. "
3628,Being recruited after just starting new job,"Remote jobs come and go. You'll find another one. If your current role is good, I'd stay there. Do you even know if you'd like a remote position? There's a lot of cons about it too. "
3629,Is $12 an hour a good starting salary offer?,"Depends on the job, but $12/hr seems pretty awful for a college graduate. My first job out of college was $21/hr before I moved into a salaried position. If it's the only thing available, take it and use the experience to make you eligible for higher paying jobs. "
3630,Extremely bad feelings about new job,"It sounds like they may have sold you on a lie, but it's still really early to tell. A lot of places need time to envelope new employees into their organization. A part of it is getting used to the new personality and learning where they fit best. Depending on the size, need, and desire of the employer to bring the new employee in, the time period varies greatly. I would keep an eye out for opportunities to invest more in the organization while remembering that you may have been misled about the position. As your post also states you're very new to the job world and starting at the bottom is unfortunately part of the deal. Your title sounds good, so maybe stick with this for awhile and keep an eye out for a new position if things don't progress? But if it's really untenable it really may not be for you. "
3631,"Leave a company or stay during a ""transition"" period?","It might be worth waiting it out and seeing what happens after the dust settles a bit. You might wind up with a promotion and a better situation to leverage for future job searching. Just keep going through the motions and maybe express interest in some higher level position at the current company. You might even get a really good offer from the guy across the street if you wait, rather than approaching his company before he might approach you. "
3632,Glassdoor listing has blatantly fake reviews and refuses to remove them.,"On the other side of the spectrum, I have written two legitimate reviews, one positive, one negative.  Both were removed and my account was blacklisted.  Any content I now post is immediately removed.  When asked about this, Glassdoor told me I broke the following community guideline: *""Each individual is allowed one review, per employer, per year, per review type.""*   
And yet from my account it is clear that I didn't.  I wrote two reviews, one for a previous employer, one for my current.  They refuse to change this decision or tell me how they feel that I broke this guideline.  Instead they have rendered my account useless. 

TLDR: Glassdoor is shady and there needs to be a more reputable source for company reviews. "
3633,How can I find companies that will pay me to work in Alaska?,"Also, there are State sponsored* programs that pay you to live there!? A friend told me about them. "
3634,"I like what I do, but I feel I don't fit in my industry and it's causing anxiety.","Can you learn both. As an older worker, future jobs will look favorably on your for being able to do your set job but understand the bigger picture and role of the company. You don't have to do it in one day but not being interested is not what you want to say. "
3635,How do you deal with a customer who cancels meetings at the last minute all the time?,"A few things. She’s cancelling because she doesn’t see the value in them. Have you evaluated the agenda and topics? Are you truly adding value in these meetings or just reporting out stuff that could be sent in an email? Strategic enough?

Another thought is if you’re taking a no from someone who can’t say yes? Are there other stakeholders you can invite to create some accountability for her? Best way to get away from a sales person is to say what they want to hear. 

Lastly, get real with her - ask! “I get the sense these meetings aren’t a priority right now. Should we reconnect next quarter?” "
3636,Are there jobs that provide housing?,Universities/colleges 
3637,"Just started a new job, is this a red flag?","I remember starting a job in March while I was in college at a tax preparation center.  That place was a disaster.  I was hired to be a general office assistant.  I took that job and ran with it.  I did the best I could to tidy the place up and keep things filed correctly.  Then, after tax season, things were much better.  Then they instituted some of my changes and the next year were much more smooth.

I would advise you use your title to see what you can improve around the office there.  If you can make some small improvements, then the organization will value you even more.

Don't let a messy office or disorganization put up a red flag.  If anything it should be a flag for opportunity. "
3638,"How do you apply for the airlines? I’m in Pittsburgh , Pa","Not a flight attendant, but I know someone who is. It's not for everyone. You need to be extremely spontaneous and comfortable with change. You also need to be outgoing and extremely accommodating. Travelers are not the easiest customers to deal with, and air travel can make emotions run high. On top of that, there are dozens of safety codes and practices you need to follow and it's different for every aircraft you fly on.

The perks are okay, but they used to be better. Industry wide, airlines are cutting back on employee travel perks so it's not as easy to fly for free. It is possible, but it will be on standby. Sometimes it's just not possible to fly when you have free time.

The pay is shit, but you could start the week in San Francisco and end it in Athens. That, in itself, is worth it to some.

Like I said, I do not work in the industry, but I am pretty familiar with it. PM with specific questions. "
3639,Is working mostly trying to keep your job?,"Its funny you mention this because my boss is questioning my level of busy. I am always busy and stressed but I can't seem to document it. They want numbers, but I wonder if it might also work to just have a schedule. Thats just the thing though, I am always stressed because I have zero time management skills. I greatly undervalue the importance of organization and planning in my job. I'm the ""get shit done"" kind of guy which is great when you have someone else telling you what needs to be done and all you have to do is work. I am struggling in this position because I am expecting my boss to do that but he expects me to actually create and schedule my own position as a manager and adapt as need be. It doesn't help that I'm always putting out fires because I don't plan any time to work on prevention. If I put a little planning into my job, I think I would be legitimately busy but not overwhelmed.  "
3640,Why is hiring old people so bad?,Older workers literally have better job attitudes (more satisfied and committed) and better performers in terms of helping out colleagues... plus it’s illegal to discriminate against them. 
3641,I am moving from PA to FL .. suggestions on jobs that will hire me via phone /FaceTime/video chat ?,I'm not sure what your experience is but I've found work outside my state by putting on top of my cover letter/resume that I will be moving to City XYZ in December 2019. That will show recruiters that you are working on getting down to the city and that you won't need relocation expenses. I've found most companies do video/phone interviews first anyway. Good luck. 
3642,Job has no breaks and it sucks,No breaks??   WOW...  No sure I could do that!!!  And doesn't sound right at all.  For 6 hours worked we are allowed a 15 min break and then optional half hour lunch/dinner.   Now you know why people are leaving. 
3643,17 yr old with Associates Degree,"Age is a protected class so you'll be fine there (assuming people play by the rules).

The bigger issues are:

1. 17 makes you a minor and state laws change things drastically for minors which an employer CAN legally say ""yeah this won't work out because of laws related to your age""

2. You're going off to (what i'm assuming to be) a four-year-school in a year max. People don't often enjoy hiring degree-holders as temps. "
3644,Weighing the Risks/Benefits of a New Job Opportunity,"When large companies take over small ones, they usually get rid of the key managers & bring their own. Would you be a key manager? "
3645,"If I get hired as an Admin. Assistant, how likely is it I'll be some boss' errand boy?","Admin ""Assistant"" usually means a full fledged administrator without the pay grade and extra jobs distracting you from your primary duty. At some point they will decide to let you go for not cleaning the toilets while a virus is running rampant on the network or a user needs data recovery. "
3646,"The company I work for is being sold (with potential buyers), what should I do?","I was recently let go from a company who was bought by an investment firm. I will tell you to update your resume and potentially keep feelers out in the job market because if the company is being sold, in the next several months to a year there are definitely going to be organizational changes and structures. 

What happened to me was my job description and responsibilities completely changed without providing me the compensation or title to do them (essentially I was doing a manager's job in an associate role) The day-to-day operations changed. Before we knew it, budget cuts came to eliminate positions and mine was one out of the 20 that were cut. 

This is the worst case scenario though which I do not anticipate happening to you. Just be prepared for new winds of change on the horizon. "
3647,Help negotiating when the salary is far off,"They gave you a low offer, you counter.

&#x200B;

""Thank you so much for the offer and wanting me to join your team, but I can't accept anything under XXXk a year.""

&#x200B;

 If they can't offer that, just keep looking. It's up to you to consider what it is you're willing to take in order to leave a life time gig that includes 16 paid weeks off. "
3648,"Could I get a job at an Amazon warehouse in a cheap, rural area (Midwest?)? Would I face a lot of competition for the job?",Amazon is always hiring.  
3649,HELP! promotional Agency has ridiculous policies. Any advice would be appreciated,"[jeeeezus Christ](https://youtu.be/5Unxp5sCmM4) this sounds like a shitty company to work for. I don’t know UK labor laws, but I’d highly recommend quitting and finding another job. Then leave negative reviews for them on Glassdoor. "
3650,"Calling out on the day of work, or ""no call no show"": which kind of job can you risk immediately losing if you do this kind of thing even once?",Lol you just stop showing up to work with no notice when you quit? What a pathetic childish action.  I hope you never get a real job and are doomed to work retail the rest of your life.  Scum. 
3651,Anyone have any experiences with working for a performing arts group/school?,
3652,Reason behind offering free drinks and ping-pong table/video games/other perks,"At my former job, the prevailing theory about the coffee area and pool/pingpong areas were that they were out in the open so that management could always see who was free to take on more work/who didnt have enough to do. "
3653,Is working at UPS or Amazon a decent career?,"I don't.  There are plenty of them though, they don't outsource that, at least they didn't when I was there. "
3654,"I’m contracted to 7 hours a week at work, am I allowed to say I can’t do a shift when I’ve been put down to do 4?",
3655,Percent of travel for 10 to 15 trips a year?,Depends on how long each trip is expected to last. 10% travel means that about 5 weeks out of the year you can expect to be traveling.  Whether that means 1 day every two weeks or one month-long trip a year is something you'll have to clarify with the company. 
3656,The environment of a payroll company,"They are over 10 years old and have multiple locations in the US. They have a good range of clients from how it sounds. One issue I hear alot is that they try to implement completely new design process of how departments work together and they have either mixed or horrible results. They tried to implement a project 2 years ago that was a complete failure. To get it into effect, they shut down 2 department and merged them with others.  After the failure, 1 of the departments failed entirely and everyone was scattered through the company. Around this time, about 4 high end managers quit with a lot of specialists. "
3657,How it's been your experience like working at major record labels?,"My friend does that. Her job for the first year was pretty menial, doing something with ticket counting for the label. She knew it would be boring. However, she stuck it out and just got promoted. "
3658,Payroll card.,"I believe they use the ADP payroll card which isn't nearly as bad about fees as some others. 

That said, you need to see the fee schedule as it's negotiated by each company that enrolls. 

The most common fee would be for reloading the card between direct deposits. ATM withdrawals are another. In network are free, outside varies. 

Yes, you can transfer funds to a savings account. Although if you have a bank account, it may be better just to enroll in direct deposit. Payroll cards are largely intended for the ""unbanked"" so employers don't have to cut paper checks. "
3659,What do you do at work when you have nothing to do and can’t leave?,"Reddit and randochat.

Nap if i'm sleepy  "
3660,HELP ME SURVIVE TODAY,"Are you out sick a lot? 

It's really the manager's responsibility to get someone to cover the shift if one of their employee's is sick, but you can call around and put in the effort, if you're not to ill to do it. If you can't get someone to cover, you are still sick, and shouldn't go in. It seems insane that your manager would want someone who is throwing up around food that is going to be served. "
3661,DAE work in a very mixed social class workplace?,Pretty common. 
3662,"I think I am in a odd job to be pay to do very little just to fulfill the funding requirements, and I am confused.","You should use the time for personal enrichment, just like they suggested. So you can learn some coding, or maybe something totally unrelated that is of interest to you...

You also called out that you don't have many marketable skills... so ok, use the time to develop some marketable skills. "
3663,Got a call from a company I applied for but there's a small problem,You're getting ahead of yourself. If they wanted to reach you they would leave a message or send an email assuming you have voicemail setup and an email on your resume (which you should if job searching). 
3664,Is this an unreasonable request by my boss/his bosses?,"It's not unreasonable for your company to expect you there 8 to 5PM, or for your job description to change. That happens regularly 

But at the same time, you're within your rights to think its absurd. You don't have a lot of leverage 5 months in... but asking about a raise doesn't hurt per se... it's just unlikely to happen.

The most likely resolution is you find a new job elsewhere, but that's not always easy either. "
3665,How to leave a union?,"""The lady then said they only accept this on ONE day of the year, and I have to send in a hand-written letter of resignation for this. Is this bullshit or a common practice?""  


I think that's common. It was the same with mine. They accepted it one day out of the year, hand written letter, and they had to have it on that day. They make it as difficult as possible. "
3666,ESAB Cutting and Welding Wages?,
3667,Joined a sinking ship?,So your on the Titanic. 
3668,What are the grooming standards at Quality Oil LLC?,
3669,[HELP] Let go from my job due to 'budget constraints' - 2 months later the company wants me back!,"If they want you back and you're out of work, you should probably go back (I doubt you're making more on Unemployment). If it were me I would ask for more pay (it never hurts to ask). 

Once working you may want to still look for a new job - especially if the pay is a lot higher. I assume you would have the same PTO since your break in service was only a few months. Why not burn some PTO days interviewing for positions with better pay? Your company proved that they're only looking out for their interests. It sounds like its time to advocate for your best interests. "
3670,What are your job/company red flags?,When the job ad makes me scratch my head and the website says nothing and the facebook or even the website for the company is full of inspirational quotes. Like WTF do you do? 
3671,Is Basecamp the wonderful place where to work they say it is?,"As always, it depends on your direct manager/team. But if they've written a book detailing their culture and they actually apply that to the way they work, then it will probably be better than most companies. "
3672,What do we think about staffing agencies ?,I went with pivot staffing for a temp to hire position with a food production company. I think I was paid around 9 or 10 an hour with a raise of 12 after hire. It was only a temp job since I had something better lined up 4 months later. Staffing agencies are paid by the company to recruit workers so that's why you got lowballed. I didnt have a bad experience but it's only if I need something short term. 
3673,Upshift .. the app,
3674,Is my.peoplematter legit?,"I called Subway (I previously had an interview at Subway) and asked if ""my.peoplematter.com"" is legit, and the guy said yes. I think that website is used by multiple resturant chains. "
3675,When executives leave,lmao our CFO told everyone he was going to go back to take care of some things in Arizona  and never showed up to the office again. They had to tow his car from the CFO parking space and move it to a regular parking space. It has Arizona plates so im sure he will show up in the middle of the night to pick it up. Google is littered with his “professional” pics  and accolades on his linkedin profile. wusss 
3676,How can I prove I deserve more hours?,"any chance it's just a slow season? if this has happened before and on a regular basis, go find a new job. "
3677,Which place is better to work at? McDonalds or Chipotle?,"It depends entirely on the individual store. Which store are you applying to? Go to the store. How does it seem to be run? Does the store manager run things well? Are things messy and does the crew look overworked?

The store manager is everything. They can make a place a joy to work at or hell on Earth. Management quality varies massively between stores. Its all about who's in charge at that specific restaurant. Thats what you should pay attention to.

Don't be shy about asking the employees either. See someone outside cleaning something? Ask him or her whats it like working there. "
3678,Company is being bought. Questions to ask future employer?,
3679,How often HR/managers who work in the same industry(from different companies) discuss potential Employees?,"Very, very rarely. If you have a shit employee you haven't figured out how to fire yet, you certainly wouldn't want to sabotage their chances of getting a job somewhere else before you have to fire them. "
3680,Question for people who work physical jobs,"Get a good pair of boots, eat lightly and stay hydrated. "
3681,Can Jobs really have “mandatory” overtime?,"Assuming they're paying you for the overtime (which, I've never heard of a non-exempt call center employee) then yes. "
3682,Anyone familiar with this job model?,I've had a job where you trained at half-pay for a month before getting fully brought on. Went well. This isn't very uncommon. 
3683,Is This How All Jobs Are In 2019?,"Right out of college, it seems like a good job. You get to dabble in different activities and build a diverse resume. Find out what you enjoy and focus on that at work.

No harm in applying to other places though! "
3684,Asking for my job title?,
3685,Boss leaching the client. How to deal with it?,so you can deliver a better product at the same budget ? 
3686,Employer Missed Payroll. Do I Jump Ship ASAP?,Get your money and get out 
3687,Working for a 'hip' company,"I worked for a 'hip' place like you describe for the last several years, recently left. I'm in the same age range as you.

The hip place was not necessarily covering up long hours. But they definitely use it to cover something. The phrase was used to be ""while we can't offer you more money, we hope you'll stay based on the culture here"". That's relatively standard in newer companies that claim to be very hip "
3688,How much do you trust Glassdoor reviews?,"I ignored the Glassdoor reviews from my previous company at my own peril.  Many people will vent, especially those that were let go against their will.  I never ignore Glassdoor reviews when it appears the author(s) too the time to pen their true thoughts and feelings.  I always take extra precautions when authors write more than a single paragraph or the writing is very specific. "
3689,Working job for roughly 3 months. Company lied about literally everything.,which country you work in ?

3691,"I'm contracted to work for a government agency but my paycheck is signed by the contracting company, not the government agency. Who should I say I work for when I update my job on LinkedIn and similar sites.","The contracting company.

You can say client facing with NOAA, or at the client site, but you are employed by the contracting company. "
3692,What are out-of-pocket expenses?,"I've worked jobs like that before. Essentially you come ""out of your own pocket"" to pay for something and the company will reimburse you for what you spent. For example I was a field engineer for a supermarket and we had to use our own cars. We would pay for our own gas and hotels/food but then the company would pay us back for it. "
3693,Software Developer looking for tech companies offering sponsorship (E3 visa for Australian citizen),"Lie.  If you pass the interview with flying colors they'll make the effort to hire you, all depends on how good you are.  Better to ask forgiveness later than ask permission first. "

3696,Does every work place have terrible quality toilet paper?,"We have about 2 Keurigs per office section, 3 in the lunch room, false light up candles that mimic real candlelight, but have thin see-through toilet paper. I don't want to pee there :( "
3697,Has anyone worked for a small family corporation?,"I've never had good experiences at family run businesses or very small companies. But I also didn't recieve those of kind of perks, so YMMV. "
3698,Is it normal to have a lot of down time in an office job?,"See downtime as opportunities to take initiative and add value. Don't ask for more work, figure out what the company needs and present initiatives to improve something. If nothing else, improve yourself! Do courses, learn new skills, increase your marketability.

Just remember that assumption is the mother of all fuckups, so if there's any doubt at all that it's the right thing to do you need to bounce it off coworkers/bosses as needed before taking action.

If initiative is not rewarded in your company, look for a new job. "
3699,"For people working in tech, your thoughts on taking a business / non-technical job in the tech industry?","I work in the technical side of my business (fiber optics- infrastructure design) but the ""non-technical"" side has tons of people with a technical background, especially sales.  It turns out that the best salespeople are the ones who fully understand customer needs, so a lot of our salespeople originally came from a different department.  "

3702,When can you not expect other employees to absorb the loss.,"It could imply they don’t see it as a key position. Otherwise it would be filled. It could be nobody is qualified to replace her. It could be the boss thinks he can get his labor costs down by not rehiring and then he would look good to his boss.

3706,"I had a nightmare interview with a recruiter years ago, and just scheduled an interview with the same person… Anything I can do?",[deleted] 
3707,What do recruiters actually do day to day during hiring freezes?,"This is a good question.

There is this perception that recruiters only recruit, but the truth is that recruiters who are just ""order takers"" aren't really as effective as true recruiters.

They are part of a recruiting team, and are probably up to their ears in everything from communicatinng and being communicated with, updating all 25 open roles they have with each candidate, every day, based on the new ""decision"" on whether or not the roles or open or not. Working with HRBPs and Management to decide which roles are ""urgent now"" ""urgent later"" ""frozen"" or ""need to continue, and in full remote access"", talking to IT to see if full remote interviews and onboarding can be done, working with Mobility to find out how these freezes will impact hires in progress or just hired who have international status, calming down recruiting coordinators who will likely be let go as all hiring comes to a freeze, and a great deal of juggling the fine line of keeping ""candidates warm"" while hoping for the best. 

Recruiters are extremely overwhelmed right now and in many cases are acting as the ""face"" of the company, while the rest of HR keeps it together on the inside. "
3708,I just spoke with a recruiter on LinkedIn via messaging who said he looked at my application and sent it to “the team.”,"I would focus on just preparing for an interview if it does happen. Do your research and showcase that you want to work there. If you want it be extra you can make something to supplement the interview - I do some nice looking slides with examples of works I’ve done before. That typically has impressed my interviewers. With that said, nothing makes up for good interview responses and just practicing reading people and demonstrating good social skills. "
3709,What are the ways I can use a recruiter's help to get a job?,"You have no career currently, and simply have a degree. You don’t need a recruiter, and they will do nothing for you. 


There are many many people in your situation, recruiters excel when you have a position you need to fill with a very particular skill set, but are too expensive for recruiting entry level roles. "
3710,Do recruiters 'own' you for a particular employer?,"Each third party agency has different contacts. 
The best line of action is to get the name of the company and apply directly ASAP. 

Applying directly helps you avoid working through an agency that will low ball you, or possibly never even send your resume over. Lying about where you have been submitted is a daily occurrence. 
 
The agency will mostly likely never tell the terms of the contract as they want you on their payroll/commission over all else. 

Good luck! —Get that company name and run for the hills! "
3711,Question about a recruiter,"RED FLAG

Say ""I am applying to a select number of companies and have been approached by other Recruiters. I need to know who you are planning to send my resume so that I know who is representing me where, and you need to know that I have not applied or been submitted by another firm."" "
3712,How to stop unending “job offers” from fake recruiters?,[deleted] 
3713,Does it actually matter to recruiters whether you have done a 2 year economics&finance master or a 2 year economics master with a minor in finance?,"Doesnt really matter. You have dedicated a relevant amount of time in both disciplines and have achieved the required standard of learning.

Make sure the degree name matches your transcript though! "
3714,How to avoid recruiters/agencies who ghost candidates?,"Promising to send you the job spec right away and never hear -- what are you talking about?

First of all, don't EVER do fing contract work. 

Go to linked in, utilize the job search and search for keywords that are you interested in with an entry level slant. Apply to the actual companies for actual career roles.

I assumed a bit in this response, if its spot on - good luck "
3715,I have an interview with a recruiter on Monday whose title is “Diversity Sourcing Specialist”. What does that mean? I’m a white guy why is she tracking me down to get me to apply for this job? Should I even bother because they’re clearly only interested in women and minorities?,"You’re a veteran. You fall into the category that she’s looking for. 

On a separate note - pure meritocracy doesn’t exist. Most white collar jobs are filled through existing connections and referrals - which is also not a meritocracy. Looking for diversity has many advantages, including 1) combat systemic disadvantages and 2) to have representation which can allow people to do their jobs better. I know people are going to ask for sources, and there’s a ton of research with a simple google search. I’d encourage you to research it if interested! "
3716,How honest should I be with the recruiter? Need advice.,Well the job impacts you and your happiness and wellbeing so you should be honest with the recruiter about where you want to be located. They can find someone else to fill the other positions. 
3717,Is it wrong to cancel an interview made through an agency?,"Nope,

Agencies are vultures. Telling you it’s unprofessional to not attend is them trying to save face with the company, nothing to do with you being ‘unprofessional’

Of all my years working I’d say 90% of these companies are terrible. All they care about is placing someone and getting the commission. "
3718,LinkedIn summary: Help me word it to let recruiters know I’m interested without my boss seeing?,"The summary is a really good place for you to inject some personality. Talk about your interests, why you do the things you do, what your goals are, and of course use keywords that are relevant to your area of expertise. [This](https://millennialmoderator.com/writing-a-great-linkedin-summary) is a helpful article on other formatting steps you can take, there are also tools mentioned that you can use to clean up grammar/wordiness, etc. "

3721,Is it ok to connect to the recruiter on LinkedIn?,"If done with an intelligent message as to why you are looking to connect, reference any correspondence you've had, along with your genuine interest in the company/position it should only be a positive. The worst case is they don't accept, the best case is your name gets back into their view (likely among many others that may not be connecting).

I say go for it! "
3722,How do I talk with a recruiter?,"Is it someone from a recruiting firm, or internal HR person at a company?

Assuming a recruiting firm, remember how these people get paid.  The hiring company pays them a very large fee if they successfully find a candidate that they hire.  Some recruiters do a lot of fishing for candidates when they don't actually have many roles available, to expand their network and so that they have lots of candidates ready to go when a role does arise, that they can pick and choose from.

That said it's a good idea to maintain relationships with them.  They may or may not have good openings right now.  They are often eager to talk to you if you have some experience in the fields they focus on, so it's a little different than normal interviews, and it doesn't necessarily reflect their likelihood of finding you a job.

Just respond,
Hi, thank you for reaching out!  I'm looking for new opportunities right now and would love to connect.  If you know of any openings I'd be a good fit for, or if you would be open to having a short call to discuss my background in anticipation of future openings, please let me know.
Best regards,
Your name "
3723,To email again or not...,I’d follow up 
3724,"Recruiter from a large, well known company reached out to me on LinkedIn for a position. Am I foolish for even getting my hopes up?","Nope, I’ve had this happen and thought it was nonsense, but it all worked out pretty well.  If it’s a well-known company and an in-house recruiter they don’t just want to scan resumes, the goal is to find the person they want to hire. "
3725,"Recruiters/Hiring Managers - Assigning ""mock strategy presentations"" to gather free ideas?","YES, VERY good!  
Please share the prompt "
3726,"Just a reminder, job recruiters WANT you to get the job. Feel free to ask them for advice.","Recruiters are parasites. Tell me why would I need you to tell me there's a position open on LinkedIn and feel entitled to 20% of my potential salary. What value do you bring me? I don't get training, insiders information, anything really.

Recruiters are a filter for big companies yet are notoriously bad at filtering because they have a bigger chance of finding a candidate by just shotgunning it. "
3727,I made a blunder with a recruiter by not realising I had already applied for the job directly,"They won't care, same thing happened to me but I was hired through the recruiter because it was a contractor position either way. 

Just leave it at that, you don't need to inform either party, they will figure it out on their own. "
3728,Looking for Energy Storage Solutions Engineer,
3729,Contacted by the same recruiter for another position.,"I was contacted by two recruiters for the opening for my old job, at my old company, two/three weeks into my job at my current company.  


They didn't even read my LinkedIn. It was literally the same job title. They shotgun just like applicants based on keywords on LinkedIn. "
3730,Thank you message after getting ghosted by recruiter,"How far along in the process were you?

There is a very strong chance that all hiring has been put on hold and they might even be doing layoffs. "
3731,"Recruiters, what are you views on Columbia University School of Professional Studies?",
3732,How would I ask a recruiter to find me a different position?,Stay in this position while looking and use it as credit to advertise yourself for a better one. Your recruiter will be thrilled to hear you are doing so well. 
3733,Applying to the same job from multiple hiring agencies?,[deleted] 
3734,Does this sound like a scam?,"If they offer to cut a check for your equipment, run. Many scammers are pretending to be legitimate companies and will literally have you sit through a fake interview, say they’ll send you a check to cover equipment costs and ask for you to return the excess money. Issue is, the check will eventually bounce and you will be liable. "
3735,Staffing agency ghosting?,"Dude, recruiters are the flakiest fuckers you'll ever meet. Never get too excited about/attached to a job that some recruiter talked to you about until you've had a phone interview with someone at the company itself. After that point, they at least owe you a ""no"" if the company didn't want to have a second interview.

&#x200B;

Gotta remember that the recruiter is not there to serve you. Who is paying them? The company, usually. A recruiter is basically a professional shopper, trying to get it done quickly as possible to move on to the next client. And what does this make you? The product, of course. "
3736,Should I go back to school...,
3737,What’s a polite way to tell a recruiter to get to the point?,"Just ask for a job description. If they play it off, it's a bullshit job. "
3738,Position posted I'm interested in and qualified for....I already applied. Recuiter contacted me about it. Should I use them?,"If you already applied through the company, almost every single agency has a clause in their client contract that says they won’t pay the recruiting fee. The client will say “We already had him apply”. The recruiting agency will stop working on your application since they won’t get paid. 

Similarly...


if a recruiter sends your information to the company and you later find a posting via internet searches and apply, then the company can’t hire you for X amount of time (usually 6 months) without paying a fee. 

However; if they have this position - they more than likely can call clients they know use similar skill sets. It doesn’t hurt to call them up and explain you saw they hire for XYZ skill set, you already applied to the company directly before finding them, but you’d appreciate it if the agency looked at your resume for any future positions that might be a good fit. "
3739,Should I take tech recruiters seriously who are unprofessional and speak broken English?,It’s so strange - as a tech recruiter - I’ve never really met any of these types of recruiters. Note: I’ve always been an internal recruiter (never agency) 
3740,What does it mean when the recruiter tells me there's no interview needed and I just need to wait for a call to schedule a drug test and start date?,They probably have a high turnover rate and is a mill

3744,What are the chances that the person whose email I need to send my CV and cover letter to is the one who will read it?,"If I understand your post correctly, the job is with this company. In that case, I would assume the email is for the hiring manager would address your cover letter and email to him. "
3745,Recruiter said they'd schedule an interview but didn't hear back yet,"You should be pursuing all offers right now, but Monday morning contact the first recruiter and let them know you haven’t heard anything yet but are still very interested and look forward to hearing. ‘Soon’ is a relative term, that could be a day or a week. "
3746,Someone help me speak the language of Recruiter,"They are scheduling 2nd round interviews as they described, and they like you enough to bring you into the round but probably you are not their first choice currently and they are prioritizing other candidates.

If a recruiter ghosted you and is not replying, something is going on internally. Either they have other candidates and you are not a top pick, the position is on freeze, the recruiter is on furlough, etc. Generally not a good sign though. "
3747,Does an employee recommending you to HR usually guarantee an interview?,No.  Doesn’t guarantee you anything. 
3748,"Payload Rack Officer position, contacted by a recruiter AGAIN",Forget the puzzle of who called whom. Do you want to pursue the job or not? 
3749,How to deal with recruiters?,"It’s advisable if they haven’t already submitted you. In most cases agency candidates are at a disadvantage because they cost 15-20% more than direct applicants due to placement fees. Most internal talent organizations have a mandate to minimize agency spend and in a lot of situations, they don’t actually give the agencies a job - the agencies find the same listing, source candidates and then present them in the hopes that they’ll get approved to work on the search. So at least ask about the relationship with the client, but if they don’t have exclusivity (which only really happens in exec search for full time roles), then make sure you apply before they submit you so that they don’t get credit for the submission and you don’t have to rely on them to negotiate an offer (a major PITA). "
3750,What do I say to employers,[deleted] 
3751,"Got a ""are you still interested in this position?"" email from recruiter 3 weeks after on-site interview. What does this mean?","It could mean all kinds of thing:

* ""I rejected you three weeks ago and wasn't going to tell you, but our top candidate turned down the offer we made them, so we are reaching out now to see if you still want the job.""
* ""It's been a crazy three weeks and getting this position filled fell low on my priority list, but I'm back now to see if you still want the job.""
* ""Somehow your e-mails went to spam folder and I only checked today.""

And, so on.  It doesn't really matter.  The question of whether you are interested in the job doesn't have any tricks to it.  Either you are still interested and are willing to overlook the time skip, or you're not. "
3752,"What seemingly innocent questions can I ask recruiters, so that I can infer how their company's truly performing?",
3753,Any service that uses your resume to find jobs for you?,"its better to load up a cv to job sites like monster, efinancials, linkedin etc u can Google up, n set up email alerts on key words, eg. web programming, retail sales, engineering, etc. u will then receive rmail alerts n alternatively check those sites everyday n scroll through open positions as u already have a cv loaded in there  just click the apply button of that job n your application is on its way.

don give up.

n oh yea, if it shows the total number of applications towards that role that u applied, do not be dishearten if u see a big number.  a professional recruitment friend told me majority are not qualified as they are just trying their luck by indiscriminately clicking the apply button.

i got my current job 2 weeks ago from this pathway after 8 months of unemployment n i am a male 50yr old with a family to support. "
3754,Why do recruiters keep ghosting me and sending me spam?,CV harvesting. They want names on their books. Internal KPIs. Don’t get me started. 
3755,Amazon Recruiting Q regarding 3rd-party recruiter policies for corporate jobs,A recruiter can't get paid for placing a candidate that's already applied and been passed over. 
3756,Do interviews care if you don’t do well with 1-2 questions of their list of 15-20?,"I really don’t think 1-2 would matter. I had an interview where I interviewed with 8 people in a span of 3 hours and some of them told me I did really well on the technical questions and I didn’t get the job. Another interview, they asked me SUPER SPECIFIC technical questions that ideally I should know the answer to because it’s so generic like ‘how does a pH meter work’ and things along those lines. I was so clueless, I had to say ‘I don’t know!.’ But, I did really well in their case study question and ended up getting a second round. So don’t worry about messing up on some of them. I think it’s all a matter of chance. "

3760,Graduating in May with Finance degree,"I don’t have direct connections I can share with a stranger, but literally apply to any and everything entry level.  Hopefully you have some internship or related work experience.  It’s gonna be tough, you may be looking for several months after the virus dies down, but literally, everything on every job site then narrow some specific companies and look at their websites, also see it recruiting firms can also help. "
3761,Absolute insane experience with recruiters. Need urgent help,"I just read your post a few times and tried to figure out what the problem is.

You need income while you wait for your security clearance. I've had a Secret clearance before, the process is slow and riddled with bureaucracy.
 
Accept Job #1. Work at Job #1 as if Job #2 doesn't exist. Once Job #2 gives you a start date, put in your two weeks notice four weeks ahead of that date. Take two weeks for yourself, then start Job #2 fresh and relaxed.

&#x200B;

And I do not mean to add salt to injury, but... three years of unemployment would scream ""something is wrong"" everywhere. Should you live in one of the ""western"" countries, that would be even more loud - with the economy...

Is there something anchoring you to your current physical location? "
3764,What is working for Hermes actually like?,
3765,Call tomorrow with a recruiter from a major company,Recruiters just ask basic questions to see if you are a suitable candidate for the job. It's like first-level basic screening. You don't need any prep for it. Just study your own resume and tell the recruiter how you think are suitable for the job. 
3766,What do recruiters see when I apply,"It varies depending on the size of the company and which ATS is used.  Here, we see only about 10% of all the applications submitted because we get hundreds for each job.  That is the Blackhole.  Not saying you aren't qualified, we are saying you aren't as qualified.  

What we see is what the ATS tells us to see and this is based on a combination of what HR requires and wishful thinking on the part of the hiring manager.  Some are real dreamers. let me tell you.

HR then phone screens whatever was kicked out and the culling process continues.  Some want too much money, need every Tuesday off and on and on.

20 applications can be whittled down to 8 to 10 and those are passed on to the hiring manager for interviews.  Here, they want one primary candidate and two backup candidates.

If there are 4 openings, multiply the whole process by 4. "
3767,"Recruiters reached out and I THINK they assume I'm a programmer. I still want a job there, but just not as an engineer. How can I be honest without getting ghosted after?",Are these companies big enough to have job openings online? Or people on LinkedIn with the job titles you would want? Preemptively tell them the jobs you’re interested in. 
3768,Should I tell recruiters that I am currently in the process of searching for jobs with other recruiters?,"More important probably to make sure different recruiters aren’t approaching the same employers on your behalf (just say ‘oh I’ve already been in contact with X employer’).

They’ll assume you aren’t exclusive, but no need to tell them. "
3769,How do you write a good cover letter for an internship position?,"Many people report that they get something around a 1% to 3% response rate for jobs.  That means, depending on your local job market for a given career path, you might apply to 100 jobs and get 1 - 3 interviews and chances are you'll get one of those jobs.   I just want to set a scale for you so that you don't think ""Man, I applied for 15 jobs and didn't get one!  There must be something wrong with me!""  That's probably not the case.  To improve your odds of getting a callback from 1% - 3% to something more like 10% - 15%, use your contacts.  That's the response rate reported by people who had a friend or contact recommend them for a particular position. "
3770,I want to renegotiate my hourly pay with a recruiter a month into my new job,I don’t understand why you didn’t just move forward with the $38/hr when the recruiter ghosted you. Can you not accept an offer without a recruiters permission? Why are you still working with him and depending on him when he’s let you down so many times? I think you need to start making decisions on your own and work in your best interest. The recruiter clearly is. 
3771,Should I tell my recruiter?,You need to take the job. You didn't get the other one. That isn't leverage. 
3772,Is this typical practice of a recruiter?,"Quick follow-up:

I had the phone interview 5 weeks ago after the director reached out to me and asked me to apply. I thought the phone interview went REALLY well, recruiter was so nice, and he offered to accept my friend request on LinkedIn, and then I never heard anything back. I sent a follow-up email five days later (the recruiter had told me he would call me the next day to arrange a face-to-face and didn’t) then waited another week and reached out on LinkedIn. He never read my message and never replied. 

This morning, I received a generic rejection email. Should I even bother to email the recruiter again to ask for feedback?  After his blatantly ignoring me for five weeks, I feel like he wouldn’t answer anyway. 

I know that recruiters are busy, and they get tons of emails, but why is it so hard to get anyone to contact me in any way?  Most jobs I apply for, I get a generic rejection email. I’ve been applying for almost a year, and I have no idea what I’m doing wrong. When I was in sales years ago, I had no problems getting to final interviews and getting jobs. Now I have a MPH and work in marketing, and I can’t even get a face-to-face interview. I had a few last year (when I had interviewed at the company above), but since then, it’s been crickets. 

Now the economy has tanked, and I feel like I’ll be stuck at this job that I hate forever. "
3773,How do I get employers to communicate by email or text?,"This is a 21st century problem.   Understand that most of your communications today will be Persona Absentia or not Face-to-Face.  Choosing the right person, the right time and the Right Medium is key to communicating, especially with what is going on today.

Always end a communique with a way, and a time in which you can be reached.  This is key today.  Mine goes something like ""I can be reached at 444-8111 and I will be here until 3:00 pm today.  I will be here all day tomorrow"".  This won't solve the problem entirely but it will cut down a lot on tech tag.

I am reaching out to customers now and many of them are not answering the phone, times being what they are and I am trying to limit my time playing phone tag.  Yes, I can email some of them but they don't always respond to that in a timely manner either. "
3774,How long should I wait to contact recruiter again?,Was told by my recruiter too that my start date was delayed 1 month and that the onboarding stuff is getting processed. So it is perfectly normal if things are slowing down due to the Coronavirus. It doesn’t hurt to contact your recruiter about your information. 
3775,Question regarding pharm sales transferring to med sales career?,"I’ve worked in both industries (not sales) and had to deal with a lot of recruiters.  

If this is an independent recruiting agency, versus a device/pharma company directly, keep in mind that these recruiters want to place you as quickly as possible.  If you come in with a high salary expectation, they see additional work for themselves of trying to negotiate your salary or not as a “sure thing” (risk of declining a job offer) - remember they get paid based on placements so it quantity over quality.  The “easier” you appear to them the better.

From an internal company perspective, we like seeing the depth of experience and it’s a big plus to demonstrate ability to decipher and successfully communicate complex data... but we rarely get those candidates in front of us!

For best success, network network network! Talk to people at booths if you attend major conferences and start collecting business cards. "
3776,I’m graduating from college and am worried about employers seeing my social media,[deleted] 
3777,What do I do when my temp recruiter does not respond for my inquiries to move to a new job?,"If you leave your placement, your recruiter does not get paid (I use to work at a staffing firm). I would just tell your recruiter you quit. Recruiters are not there to help you, so chances are they aren't going to want to work with you but it's not personal. If you want out you need to stick up for yourself. "
3778,Any Advice for a CCAT?,How did it go? 
3779,Question: Working with more than 1 recruitment agency for positions in same company?,"> I googled around and most people are saying that it's not a good idea to have multiple recruitment agencies represent you for positions in the same company... aka double-dipping.  

Its not a good idea because in many cases, the company is ""price shopping"".  Not saying this is your case but its not uncommon for a company to take a position and give it to several recruiters and let them beat the bushes.  Often,they are looking for a low bidder. "
3780,Can I look for temporary work while currently signed to a contract?,"You are definitely allowed to keep the search up! 

I would suggest being transparent about it but don't worry about the agency as it would be expected that their candidates are seeking other employment when they aren't working.

If it were me, I would start applying and only really mention it once you receive an offer. Just a quick email saying thanks for your help but I would like to back out of this role as I have received an offer. Maybe give them 2 weeks notice in case it picks up and they need you to work, but you otherwise don't owe them anything. 

Good luck!

A lot of recruiters don’t contact you if they’ve moved on with another candidate, it’s just the nature of the game. We’re required to talk to x amount of people a day and send y amount of resumes to hot jobs but never required to contact people that aren’t moving forward.

3791,"External Recruiter represented me in interview process but we realized a complication due to my previous application, how to proceed","Hopefully it works out for you. Something very similar happened to a friend of mine and she’s been at the job for 3 years. She had applied directly through the company months prior but never got a response. She then applied through an external recruiter and got an interview. The company didn’t want to pay the recruiter but I personally think she wouldn’t have got the job without the agency. Not sure where it landed - just know she did end up with the role! 

Good luck :-) "
3792,How to find recruiters to work with?,"Find one of the job sites (indeed, linkedin, dice, ziprecruiter, etc.)  Many of the jobs are from recruiters so if you apply for those, sooner or later, you'll get contacted by a recruiter. "
3793,Acceptable forms of contact,"What about using a Google Number on the online version of your resume? That way, though you'll still get the phone calls, you can pre-screen. "
3794,Is it customary to write a thank-you e-mail after a phone screen/introductory call?,I just had two phone interviews today and sent them each a quick thank you email. I think it just helps them to remember you if they’ve had multiple phone interviews and it’s a nice courtesy. 
3795,Will it rub a recruiter the wrong way if I ask for a speedy start to hiring process?,"No. I actually had a job offer already, when I was contacted by a CTO. I told them my situation, and they got their act together. They shuffled things around so they could interview me the next day, Friday. Then they had a job offer for me on Monday. "
3796,Saying no to a candidate when they have more interviews scheduled?,"Give them the “thanks, but no thanks” short email.  Or, as an act of respect, call and let them know that they will not be moving forward in the process.

If they are already on site, interrupt the process and say the remaining persons are not going to be available.  Then give them the short email/call next week "
3797,Is it quite weird to send the recruiter with the updated resume?,"No, that’s what you should do. "
3798,Is it okay to just not return a call for phone screening/interview?,"I wouldn't worry about it. You don't owe them anything. If they're that pity and ridiculous and decide to blacklist you, then you don't want to work there anyway. "
3799,Multiple Recruiters For Company I Applied For?,
3800,"If a potential employer says ""lets explore opportunities"" does that mean they might be interested in hiring me or are they just being polite?",They want to hire you. It's a statement of invitation. 
3801,"Indeed job posting which seems to good, possible scam ?","Scam.  The tip off is that  you probably have never actually talked to a person have you?  Always try to get them to call you. If they start storytelling online about why they can't, then its a scam. "
3802,Lost out on job opportunity b/c recruiter went on vacation. What lessons should I learn?,"Do you know for sure the recruiter never passed on your resume? I gotta say her communication is awful. I think she should’ve informed you if she was going on vacation in the middle of your process. Or even if she didn’t she could’ve replied to your email from her phone like “hi , I am actually away from my desk on vacation right now. But I assure I did forward your resume and am waiting for a response for the employer”. And why isn’t she responding to your emails now?

I do agree with the whole if they already agree to apply to send your application you’re not supposed to over them and submit another application directly. But if this happens again and lots of time passes & you haven’t heard back, I don’t think a direct application would work. 

If it was me, I wouldn’t want to work with her again. I’d rather have someone who updates me & answers emails. "
3803,Recruiter reaching out to me about a position I don’t have much experience in,Maybe. If it looks interesting and isn’t too far away then there’s no harm in going along with it. 
3804,Dealing with job offers.,"Around 80% of people who accept counter offers still leave the company within 6 months of acceptance... You've obviously been job hunting for a reason, time to move on by the sounds of things! "
3805,A recruiter contacted me on linkedin - I am a little skeptical,"I literally had someone post a fraudulent job posting for a real company on LinkedIn. I then spoke with who I thought was HR for like 2 weeks and was getting more and more skeptical. Thing is they used the name of the HR person for the real company. 

Anyway, I did a reverse lookup on their email and found they're based out of the Netherlands. I confronted the fake and they never responded lol. I then reached out to the real person and let them know. "
3806,Do you bother with firms that have a bad reputation on the review websites?,"I would avoid that most recent place like the plague. Unless the reviews are a few years old and management/team has changed since. I took a role last year ignoring a terrible review on glassdoor. Within a couple of weeks I realised it was all true. I left after three months, it was possibly the most toxic poorly run organisation I've ever seen. It's since gathered dozens of equally terrible reviews and not one positive.

I now look at the overall theme of reviews. You'll likely always get a disgruntled employee at almost all companies but if the balance of reviews are positive I'll speak to them. I do have a few red lines that if I see in a lot of reviews I rule them out. Life is too short to be in a miserable job! "
3807,Missed calls/ calls not being returned,"Call them back and give them an exact time they should call you the next day. Say if that doesn't work you're more than happy to coordinate via email.  You can also put your contact hrs on your applications and resume, but giving them specific times is ideal no matter the situation. Saying ""call me back sometime"" is very different than ""I will be available tomorrow between 11-1pm, please give me a call back then if possible"" "
3808,"Good employment agencies, how do you find them?","The only way to be able to tell that is to find out for yourself. When you interview for a job, this interview is a 2 way street. You also have to consider the place you are interviewing at and the person interviewing you. You would judge them based on the same criteria you would anyone else- is the office clean? Is the person professional? Did they offer me something that I would like? 

I can’t tell you how to know one is good because I only know what is my perception of a good employment/staffing agency. This is going to be different for everyone and you have to define that yourself. You have to ask yourself what is important to you. "
3809,Is submitting an application to the same job multiple times bad?,"If it's an updated resume, sure. But, if you're just spamming their mailbox they might just start ignoring them after a few views. "

3811,Do recruiters send you to interviews knowing you don't have a chance?,[deleted] 
3812,Is the recruiter lying to me or am I overthinking things?,"In the time it took you to post this you could have done what she asked and sent the email. Recruiters are on the phone all day. They may talk to 50 people in a day, easy, especially when sourcing for entry level. Send the damn email. "
3813,Looking into using a recruiter. Where do I begin the search for a quality recruiter?,"You don't find them, they find you. "
3814,Got terminated and then two recruiter added me on LinkedIn of the same company?,Yeah so leave those cockroaches there and continue your journey upward! Really despise recruiters! 
3815,Recruiter contacted me to gauge my interest for a marketing position. How should I respond?,"“I’m not really looking for a new position but I am interested in the job. Could you tell me more about it, and possible compensation?”

You answered your own question. "
3816,Looking for thoughts on a position posted by different recruitment agencies.,">  Is there any meaning behind another recruiting company posting the same position? 

It's not uncommon for a company to take ONE position and outsource it to several  recruiters. What the company is doing is ""price shopping"".   You are much more likely to get the job, if you go with ""the low bidder"". "
3817,Can I talk to another hiring manager at the same company?,"Is it for a different position? If so, it’s probably fine.  But keep up your job hunting efforts elsewhere because it appears they perhaps didn’t find you ideal. 

If it’s for the same position, there’s probably not multiple hiring managers so eventually you’ll likely be funneled back to the original interviewer. "
3818,"Three recruiters emailed me today about the same position, should I just stick with the first one?",If it’s through a staffing agency avoid them. They most likely don’t have the job and just want your resume. I know from experience from agencies. 
3819,Is it worthwhile to question job recruiters about potential wage increases?,"Who are you actually working for?  An agency?  

If so, it wouldn’t necessarily be the recruiter you’d speak to about a salary increase, but the account manager for the agency. 

However, you’re within your rights to reach out to your contact and ask them about conducting a wage review based on your certifications 

Note that just because they’re paying these two new hires more than you isn’t a valid justification for a pay increase.  Your new certifications are the justification "
3820,"Offered an in person interview, but haven’t applied yet? Need help",Ask the recruiter. 
3821,LinkedIn recruiter wants to chat by phone about opportunity,don't get involved with recruiters at all 
3822,How to approach a recruiter with a proposal for a role I could fill?,"You should find someone in a business developer role at the recruiting firm to accomplish this. You need to submit a business development strategy. It would not be like applying for a job, so you will have to approach it differently than a resume/cover letter. "
3823,Is anyone a recruiter here? Wondering how much I’ll get directly after my temp-to-hire stage through a third-party recruiter.,"I'm contract to hire... They want to hire me on and I asked... Wasn't any problem. My recruiter also had emails that said what the possible pay would be.

If your not comfortable asking the company yourself... See if your recruiter has any info.

Generally... Expect less if you don't get benefits... As the benefits will usually push you over a contract salary even tho it's less in salary. "
3824,Should I leave a voicemail to an employer who reached out to me or just wait until the next day to call when they are open?,"You don't need to be overly apologetic. It's the holidays, people are busy-- even if it weren't the holidays, people have commitments. But otherwise I think your wording is fine. "
3825,How to Thank A Recruiter,Don't give him a gift.  Thank him and recommend him to others. 
3826,What to ask recruiters? (LinkedIn),"Ultimately they probably won’t respond, or will be annoyed by you reaching out on LinkedIn as I’m sure they get a lot of inquiries.  That said, if you insist on doing it, find a job you specifically want, apply formally online and make sure you’re clear you’ve done that. "
3827,Is getting texted by recruiters a thing now?,"Yup. There are tools where they can text from their computer and keep a bunch of texts running at once. It makes their communications easier and since most recruiters have quotas for communications, it helps them keep track of those. "
3828,Unethical Recruiting Practices?,"If you’re asking why the 29 doesn’t add up to the 45k, it’s possibly they take a cut out of it as commission "

3831,Information needed on recruiting services and how they can help a recent graduate land a job!,"> Is a recruiting service the way to go for someone in my position? 

Sure!  It's a common misconception to think that recruiters and temp roles are restricted to secretarial type work.  You should not pay them any money to work for them or through their service. Typically, the employer pays the temp agency $X per hour of your work and they pay you a smaller $x per hour.  The temp agency makes money on the margin between what the employer pays them and the lesser amount they pay you.  

These are often project and overflow positions where the big name company doesn't want the expense of on and off boarding lots of people quickly and the liability of legal action resulting from early terminations, worker's comp, etc.  If you have no experience, it would definitely be worth your time and, as you say, investment in your future self, to take a financial analyst position through a temp agency.  Maybe there's a company that is has a seasonal business and needs an extra hand for three or six months.  I'd gladly take that or a few months of project work so that my resume looks great -- plus the people you meet and connections you make can actually put you in long term roles. "
3832,General Degree Vs Honours Degree,"Nobody has a crystal ball that can predict the future, so time will tell how smart your decision was.

But consider this - grads need A LOT of help standing out from one another. Having an Honours degree could help with that. 

Grads need 50% great education, 50% great experience, and 50% luck. That deliberately add to more than 100% because that's how nuts it is right now.

Godspeed OP "
3833,LinkedIn recruiter etiquette and insight,"Corporate Recruiter here...

Good Recruiters find people mostly via the skills and experience listed on your profile and when we send messages, we will highlight those in the message. Bad recruiters will use the shotgun approach and just sent out a bunch of messages and see what sticks.

If you're happy where you're at, then simply click the ""not interested"" button as that will automatically send a message back for you. From the perspective of the Recruiter, some companies measure how often Recruiters get responses back on those messages so doing at least that is always nice. And it takes roughly 2 seconds.

If you don't want to network you obviously don't have to. Is it a good idea to network? Obviously yes as you never know what is going to happen in the future. If a Recruiter doesn't say what company they're representing in the initial message, you can always ask. If they won't tell you, then just say you're not interested. 

All things considered, these things take a matter of seconds in reality and don't take much effort on your part. And in regard to this statement...

> I am generally happy in my position due to flexibility, work/life balance, co workers and project types, but am also curious about other opportunities and taking on more since I am <4 yrs in the industry. 

You'll never know what's out there if you don't respond to a message from time to time. "
3834,"Had a strange email from a startup recruiter, is this legit?",We have no idea if this is legit or not but my money would be on scam. 
3835,Agency just reposted the job I applied to weeks ago and had an interview with yesterday...should I be worried I’m not getting it?,"I'd be worried, yeah. Might be worth emailing or calling the person you interviewed with. "
3836,Question,"Always keep applying, until you get and accept an offer. "
3837,11 months since graduating and still unemployed....depressed after realising that I graduated with the wrong degree.,What about becoming a police officer?  
3838,Would it be appropriate to contact the recruiter?,Absolutely contract them if they contacted you. Yes you may have waited too long unless they said they were doing anything until after the holidays. No hurt in trying though. 
3839,I've never worked with recruiters or staffing agencies before. What are the gotchas I should watch out for?,[deleted] 
3840,(Update) My employer has a non-solicitation clause with a client. This client tried to recruit me for a higher paying position.,Awesome sauce!!! 
3841,How do you find a recruiter's contact info to follow up on a job application?, LinkedIn if you know the name. 
3842,I hate writing cover letters!!!,"Take heart, tender rose petal.  We don't accept cover letters anymore.  Nobody ever read them anyway.

It depends on the industry of course, but cover letters are on their way out. "
3843,How to go about cold calling/emailing for a job or internship,
3844,I got an ”we let you know if there is some opening”,
3845,Hiring manager said she would call then didn't. Should I have called her?,"You should treat these kinds of situations as you would, if you already were working there. If the hiring manager didn't do something as promised, you sure can contact them instead. "
3846,Headhunter Etiquette,"You should work with more than one headhunter.  They both have their own contacts and inroads that are built.  If your headhunters check in with you and pay attention to you, then you should do the same with them.  Let them know when you interview and if you think that you will be getting an offer soon.  Be honest with them.  Good and responsive headhunters are hard to find. "
3847,Help! I was referred to a company and built a relationship with a recruiter but I recently found out the recruiter was let go?,"Reach out to the recruiter using the email address initially provided. Odds are, their emails are being forwarded to a colleague who took over their case load.

Also reach out to the recruiter directly via LinkedIn. Perhaps they will direct you to a former coworker who you can contact about the position. "
3848,Aerotek Recuitment?,"My first job out of college was a call center temp job I got through Aerotek. They hired about 20 people because they were expecting heavy phone traffic in the next few months which did happen. 

I think part of it was that I was a bit ignorant about how all of it all works because it was my first job after school, but I didn’t really know it was a call center until my first day. I don’t think the rep used the word and I don’t even remember what he called it. I had been unemployed for four months and was pretty desperate.

I would say to just be careful and to do your research to limit the chances you are thrown into a position you don’t want. I had two reps and the initial guy pressured me a bit into accepting the job offer by saying that the company was looking for an answer by the following day. The second girl was really nice and when I left that job for another she was really understanding. 

Also, don’t be afraid to tell the recruiter that you don’t want to accept or interview for a job if it isn’t what you want or is too far away ect. And don’t let them pressure you into taking a job you don’t feel will be right for you. "
3849,"Is it bad to use the recruiting company that helped me find my current job, to help me get a new job?","I think it's a good idea to re-use them if you had a good experience. I think they'd be pleased to have a repeat customer, so to speak.

I'm not sure on the legality of them telling your current employer on you, but it could be a risk. Some recruiters have strong bonds with HR at frequently placed companies. "
3850,Working 40 hours a week in HS vs College,"It depends on the college, your major, and how much personal life you're willing to sacrifice.  With 12 credits, you'll typically be in class 12 hours a week.  If you study another 15-20 hours a week, you'll still have time to work 40 hours, but you won't have a lot of time for the social aspect of college.  That's o.k., as long as you understand it going in.

What you really need to think about is how long it's going to take you to graduate.  With only 12 credits a semester, you'll most likely not graduate in 4 years.  This means you'll have additional tuition payments to make.    


It sounds like you're a good student.  Are AP classes an option?  Or do you have the option of taking classes at a community college right now to earn HS and college credits simultaneously?  The more you can do to earn some of your college credits now, the better off you are. "
3851,Weird recruiter linked in message,"Sorry, so he did post my area of work I just edited it out because it's a super niche area. I do love my current job but am getting frustrating with how sucky our health insurance is. I don't want to burn this bridge for something that doesn't work out/is spam "
3852,Set multiple locations on Indeed?,[deleted] 
3853,Did a burn a bridge with a recruiter?,What were you expecting to get out of that? That they were going to pay you even more? You should have just declined the interview and moved on. 
3854,How to end a relationship with a staffing agency?,Just write a simple letter of resignation and keep it polite and courteous. Many temp agencies will rehire you or even try to get you back with them after you've quit working for them as long as they didn't fire you. You may even be able to use your last supervisor as a reference. They understand that people don't want to do that type of work for the rest of their careers. 
3855,Why recruiters role move so quickly?,"Cause they want money.  They take the resume with the most buzzwords and ship it to their clients.  From what I experienced, I suggest people to work with lead or senior recruiters.  The regular scrubs will call you today and leave you tomorrow. "
3856,Asking the recruiter about the second job?,"It's not rude. A third party recruiters job is to get people placed in positions so they can get paid. To that end, it benefits them to have more irons in the fire for you, so to speak. "
3857,Should I apply using a recruiter or directly (already have reached out to head of department myself),"Recruiters are scavengers.  If you're already connected through people at the company, run with it.  Tell the recruiter you have an internal connection and that you don't want to jeopardize the application you already have, or just tell them you've already applied if you want to be non-confrontational.

Recruiters can certainly help you- I got my last two positions through introductions via recruiters....but they were largely useless once they got my foot in the door.  I have worked with some that are terrible and some that are phenomenal.  I had one guy that did a fantastic job, even sent me a thank you note after I landed.  I've had plenty of others just waste my time and do nothing. "
3858,Any HR people out there that can shed some light on why you may contact a candidate asking for an interview and then completely not respond?,find her on LinkedIn and send an invitation to connect 
3859,Question for recruiters/HR - Do you ever challenge the low pay offered for some roles?,"> Do you ever challenge the employer? Lower their expectations? What do they say? 

In the US, not so much anymore.  With computers and data bases, its pretty easy to find out what the price of a loaf of bread goes for or what we should be paying for an entry level accounting clerk.

Now where we get into trouble is when they are looking for exotic, Holy Grail skill sets.  Its harder to pin those salaries down. "
3860,Appropriate etiquette when contacting recruiters on LinkedIn/other platforms?,"Don’t do that, if you see a job posted apply for it formally through LinkedIn or the company’s website, if you can find the recruiter’s email use that, it not use LinkedIn, create a shortened version of your cover letter and explain you’re really interested in the position, formally applied online but also wanted to reach out directly and how you think you can help the company and include your resume.  Be specific with hiring managers/recruiters on LinkedIn, they’re busy and aren’t trying to do your job search for you, you have to find the job first before reaching out generally. "
3861,Why do these recruiters from LinkedIn instantly want to jump onto a phone call with little to no information beforehand?,"it's not just on linkedin. i've worked with a temp agency/recruiter for two years and just about any time she had a new assignment for me, she'd barely give me any details. i put up with it for a long time because i needed the money and because i thought doing that would eventually pay off, but things didn't work out. she knew i was a capable worker/person that could do just about any job well, so she relied on me to take care of the low level jobs no one else could do. i assume that they give little to no information because they know if they tell you everything, you won't be interested. "
3862,Should I follow up with a temp job recruiter after he submitted me for four different positions?,Send an email thanking them for submitting to the four jobs and you’re excited for the one interview and look forward to hearing back from the other roles. 
3863,Recruiter wants last 4 of social?,"It's basically to create a unique identifier for you in their system. You can always make up any four numbers for your SSN if you want, it's not like they will ever know the difference. "
3864,How have many of you gone about getting a recruiter to help you?,"Hi, there are A LOT of factors that can play into this...seniority of role/level of salary, how ""specialized"" your skill set is (and demand for it), are recruiters able to find your resume out there (ex. like having the right keywords in your resume)...

The hiring game has changed, you can't just post your resume out there and hope someone ""picks"" you....you need to actively network, apply to as many positions that are related to your skill set (they don't have to be a 100% match), and be patient (I know, that sucks), and just like you did, find agencies who specialize in your field. "
3865,LinkedIn - do you reply to unsolicited interview offers?,"I have 0 plans to leave my current position, even if I'm only making standard for the area. It's a really nice place so I am very upfront about the only thing to even make me consider leaving is at least double what I am making now, triple if I'll need to move to a metro area. Not salty, or frustrated, just ""I'm sure it's a great opportunity, but I am in an ideal place for myself right now and I would need at least <$$$> to consider relocating""

As for responding to every single one, you gotta evaluate that based on them and your own values/appraisal of their organization. "
3866,Reminder to check if the recruiter is legit,"I’ve had a couple of calls like this. One of them said they will train me for the job but it’s gonna cost $600 usd. This seemed very suspicious so I looked it up on Reddit and lo and behold, redditors warmed me of this scam. "
3867,Got contacted by a possible scamming staffing agency,"In situations like this, I find it's generally best to go with your gut reaction. Our subconscious is quite adept at picking up on things, even if our conscious mind isn't aware of them. The high pressure sales pitch is what seems suspicious to me. I can't imagine a legitimate company would keep badgering you every day if you don't express interest in their services. Also, how much money could they possibly be making if they're paying for travel costs? One round trip ticket and hotel stay could practically wipe out the entire $500 you pay them. 

Just my opinion, but I'd say run as fast as you can in the other direction unless you're willing to risk $500 to let the rest of us know if they're indeed a scam company. Next time they call, tell them to piss off and stop calling you, block their number, and maybe report them to the FTC just for good measure. "
3868,Being absolutely spammed by recruiters when a new job req drops - what's going on?,[deleted] 
3869,I emailed a recruiter to negotiate salary and they never replied to my email. What should I do next?,Is the person's phone number in the email? I would call on Monday during business hours and hope they pick up. That way you can get a direct response from them. 
3870,missed called from potential employer,"Call back, dont wait for them to call you again. This has happened to me before and I freaked out thinking I missed my opportunity, but after calling and explaining why I missed the call it was fine. :) "
3871,"Interviewed for Financial Analyst position, Feel like I was bait and switched.","You are getting the run around. They'll post ads for jobs that don't exist, at least not anymore, just to get you to apply and get your contacts. Robert Half and Accountemps are the same company but function differently so one resume doesn't cover both companies for whatever reason. I learned this long ago but when you do sign up with an agency, do an interview but do not give our your contacts or take those stupid assessment tests until there is a real job you are applying for. In the end they really don't care about your career, it's about their numbers and filling their positions. You need to be clear about your salary/ requirements and don't back down. If they say there is a position available, they need to tell you the details and forward you a job description. "
3872,Is the recruiter trying to tell me something? Has the position been filled?,Definitely forget about it. And let it be a surprise if you hear from them. 
3873,Reaching Out to a Recruiter,"Im a recruiter and I say go for it!  Even if it doesnt lead to anything, it at least opens up communication.

Anything to break through the wall! "
3874,Unsolicited Job Offer?,"Probably one of those where they give you a check that’s more than what they were supposed to pay you, then say “oops can you send us the difference” then the check they sent you bounces. "
3875,Two recruiters in the same week miss my phone screen interview times? (auto reply stating recruiter on vacation?? 😐0.o),Glad you got that awesome offer! :) 
3876,Recruiters: how impressive/doesn't make a difference when a candidate puts together a plan?,"I had a candidate do this once.  It didn’t go over well with me. Usually the hiring manager has an idea of what he/she wants you to fix.  If you start making assumptions about what problems exist, you will probably be wrong. Also, you may insult the hiring manager by assuming you (a person with no knowledge of the company) can identify and solve the problems better than someone who has been there for years.  Don’t do it.  When the hiring manager asks you if you have any questions, you should ask them what they expect to be accomplished 30, 60, and 90 days into the job.  Let them identify what the issues are for you then you can comment. "
3877,Is Rocs Grad Staffing Legit?,"It's a standard employment agency. I'm not sure it's a ""scam"" but these agencies aren't really that great to work with. I'd try getting something on your own. "
3878,How do you react when recruiters offer your a worse job than you applied for or submit you for a job you never signed up for?,Say you’re not interested. 
3879,Question about Independent Recruiting,"It's best to apply directly to companies and work with their internal HR personnel. Third party recruiters create all sorts of unnecessary layers of bureaucracy and can make candidates much more expensive to hire because of the commission they receive on top of whatever pay the candidate gets. Also, they have contact metrics that they are judged on, similar to how call center employees have call quotas. There are all sorts of ways for 3rd party recruiters to make it seem like they're working hard on your behalf while they're just going through the motions in reality. "
3880,"Multiple recruiting firms, same job?","I can do you one better, I got contacted by two recruiters from the same staffing company about the same job and they had no idea they were working on the same job.

Jobs aren't always given exclusively and in most cases recruiters are paid only when they find the candidate. It's very normal for companies to use multiple recruiting companies. "
3881,"""The Recruiting Professionals"".. anyone heard of them?",Scam. 
3882,Should I ask to be reconsidered for a position I declined a few months ago?,"Don’t focus on your personal circumstances when you re-engage then. Focus on the impact you’ll have and reiterate that you were excited but the conditions weren’t right at the time. If they wanted you then they will want you now. So long as you didn’t string them along unnecessarily or act disingenuously, they should at least consider you. As a hiring manager,  I can tell you it’s a small world (professionally) and people cross paths all the time. Consequently, they have no reason to harbor ill will and good talent is hard to find, especially in this job market. "
3883,How do you respond when a recruiter asks you how much you make at your current position?,"Where are you from? If US, some states are illegal to ask it, particularly states in the west coast. 

As a recruiter it certainly helps to volunteer current salary but I'll take expectation as good as your word. Some would push hard on asking for a lot, but for me if your raise is something you're aiming at for a move, then I'd tell the recruiter you're expected to get a raise for XX amount. "
3884,Is this email appropriate to send to a recruiter?,"Looks good, just make sure that your email address is not dabatron_710@yahoo.com

Unless you’re applying for a vape manufacturer, in that case, you might be alright! "

3886,"When getting responses to applications, recruiters are calling and not emailing - how can I get them to email?","You can try saying that you can respond to email faster, but if calling is the norm for them, you are basically asking them to do something different for you.  If they otherwise have plenty of applicants, there’s no reason for them to make an exception for you unless you are uniquely qualified for the position.  If they are leaving voice mail messages just call them back as soon as humanly possible. "
3887,HELP: SmartRecruiter Email not correct? Kind of urgent,She hasn't checked it yet. 
3888,Possible Job recruiter scam?,"Some startup, they might use HR as recruiters for the first few years. Usually startups are short handed and you might have to do multiple roles until the company grows bigger. This might not be the case though since you mentioned. That corporate won’t allow anything hand written. 

You do need documentation to work in the US. This is part of the I-9 form and includes driver license and social security, but you should be able to use other stuff like passport as a alternative. "
3889,Is it Bad Ettiquette to Contact Multiple Recruiters at the Same Recruiting Company?,"Yes, this is a problem unless they have an agreement to share a client. They work on commission. "
3890,Internal recruiter set up last minute phone interviews. Is that normal? Any tips?,If it is an internal position it doesnt seem too strange to me. Or at least wouldn't be at my current work place. Everyone is expected to have their calendars up to date and recruiters  sometimes set up on behalf of hiring managers. I would say it is a good sign. If they weren't considering you the hiring manager and team wouldn't bother. Sounds like your app might have been strong enough to skip the recruiter phone screen. 
3891,How to turn down an agent without ghosting and how to explain vacation next March?,"ARE you looking for a job?  Why are you turning down jobs that seem like promotions?  Obviously she thinks you're worth sending to the companies.  If you want a new job, go for it and when they make an offer you tell them you have a pre-booked vacation at that time. "
3892,What to do when the same vacancy is advertised both by the company directly and by external recruiters?,Apply directly on the company website. 
3893,"applying for a job in Amazon ,my qualification is perfectly matching , but never got phone call","You'll find that a lot of employers now, especially for popular positions, won't give you any reason for rejection, and many won't even let you know. "
3894,How do you feel about staffing agencies?,"Well, being in part a recruiter  (I am actually a business developer) I can only give you my view.  I work very hard with applicants with whom I bond and care for on professional level.  I also care for my client (companies) and I know this sounds like a pollyanna thing but the biggest reward is matching people to companies and they stay there.  All my matches are team efforts, which means the candidates need to do their homework on what they want--salaries, corp. culture and location as well as the specific job.  Then we get to work and see what is out there.  Since I don't work on commission, my greatest reward is seeing someone land the job and my disappointment is when a great candidate misses out on an opportunity.   I am moving more into business developemnt because frankly recruiting is emotionally draining, difficult and I (and probably many recruiters) take rejections too personally, which over time can be debilitating.  They say don't take your work home, but that's hard to do when you know about dire financial situations.  When you care, recruiting is truly a 24 hour job.  Sorry about this long-winded reply but go ahead and work with staffing agencies but stick with the recruiter with whom you connect. "
3895,"I think I just annoyed a job recruiter who was recruiting me for my dream position, need some insight if I broke protocol when dealing with the recruiter","Maybe he was having a bad day, or maybe he’s just a dick, who knows. It’s totally reasonable to call, you didn’t violate any secret protocol or anything like that. Don’t be afraid to interact with the recruiter... they make money when you get hired, and they generally don’t make so much that they can afford to tank any candidate who calls them! "
3896,"Reaching out to recruiters for coffee on LinkedIn, is this a no-no?",I think you are better off reaching out to managers within the company.  That’s who makes the hiring decisions and knows what problems the company has. 
3897,Response to Recruiter Email,"Well what did the email say/ask? 
If it asked if you want to set up an interview with them, say yes! Don’t be telling them everything you think you are deficient in.  Presume they know your background if they read your info. You want to get in front of them so you can dazzle them!! "
3898,Can HR see me as being at fault for this?,Ive stopped trying to talk to her bc its weird to be ignored and its probably more comfortable for the both of us. 
3899,"Quit without notice yesterday, what do I tell recruiter i'm meeting with tomorrow?","I did something similar. I’ve just been telling recruiters it wasn’t a good fit. If they push for details, I tell them it was a toxic work environment with serious personality conflicts, that I tried my best to work it out, but decided it was wiser to leave. Cause it’s the truth! "
3900,A Question about LinkedIn,"One of my nephews is a detective and he says that if he is looking for you, one of the first places that he looks is Facebook (and all the other social media sites).   It is kind of a ""Choose One"" or none decision. "
3901,Concerns about a Recruiter,You did not do anything wrong.  Not every HR employee is a good HR employee and you found one. 
3902,I passed my phone interview and she wants to interview virtually tomorrow. Isn’t this kind of too soon?,"It just means they don't feel like bringing you to the office until they're sure they want to pursue you.
Unless it's a low wage job, I doubt they will even start you before the 16th... It's rare for a company to have their crap together enough to bring you in less than a week after the job offer. So yeah, the 16th is fine.
Just focus on doing well in the virtual interview. Remember to sit up straight, smile, and dress nice just like you would in person. "
3903,How do I thank a recruiter that's been really good to me?,Send flowers and chocolates  
3904,Recruiters Ghosting me after first response?,Follow up. I tend not to go with external recruiters as they usually only take the top people and leave the rest to fend for ourselves. 
3905,"I was laid off two days ago, closure interview?","Do you live in a state where it is legal to record your conversations without the knowledge to other parties?  If so, record it and go on record documenting how the work conditions changed and they became more aggressive about it to you.

If you are a female, drop “sexual discrimination “ in the text of the conversation.

Then let a civil rights attorney listen to the recording. "
3906,Responding to work emails post-layoff,"""I want to help but it may violate the terms of my layoff. I should only respond to requests for help from [manager who laid me off]"" "
3907,"My position was cut $7,000, what should I do?","Just apply and if they rehire you, accept while continuing to interview elsewhere. This is a scummy company. "
3908,Are my coworkers (and possibly me) about to be laid off?,"If you've ever seen the movie Office Space, this sounds almost exactly like that. I'd say your assessment sounds pretty much spot on. Other possibility is that in that meeting with the three of you they'll be explaining that they're dumping the workload of the other two on you three. Sad reality is, you're probably still there because you're the cheapest. "
3909,For anyone that has been laid off or fired. Are these some warning signs? Or am I being paranoid?,Least experienced but able to do the job may remove risk. 
3910,"Hello, I was told my entire department will be outsourced in August.","I would job search on platforms such as Glassdoor or Indeed. If you have time, I would also work on building/ updating your LinkedIn profile and network. Be sure to add all of your experience and connect with those in your field. Another thing that is on the rise is video resumes! This is a great way to stand out when applying for new jobs. I got my summer internship during COVID-19 due to my video resume. I recorded it through [VCV.me](https://VCV.me). It was super easy and beneficial! "
3911,Do companies have any expenses when their workers are furloughed? CA,"Usually on furlough the company pays the health benefits, and sometimes their premiums go up when their employees claim unemployment. They might just lay people off to reduce headcount and restrategize what they want to do with the finances they have. There wouldnt be a reason to lay off you all if they planned to have you return within a couple months. However, I think for financial purposes, they'd rather just lay people off if they arent planning to use them anymore. "
3912,Just Got Fired For The First Time And Not Sure How To Move Forward,"Do what will make you the most happy! You have the qualifications to go either direction. When looking for a new job, I would suggest taking the first step of updating your LinkedIn. Add all of your qualifications, degrees and experiences. I would also try to gain more connections. Another thing on the rise are video resumes. Recording a video resume helped me to gain a summer internship within five days. I recorded mine through [VCV.me](https://VCV.me). It is free and easy and will allow you to show employers your personality and enthusiasm for whichever path you choose! "
3913,Employer not carrying on furlough from July 31st,"To clarify- are they discontinuing the furlough and telling him to go back to work, or is this effectively a lay off notice with poor wording? "
3914,Poor furlough management,"I at least got the gift of a meeting when I was furloughed back in April. Mind you, I wasn't given a reason as to why *I* had been furloughed, but the other three members of my management team weren't. I'd been there longer than all three of them to the tune of 1-2 years more, but I'm almost positive I'm making *less* than all three of them as well.

The furlough also came with the promise of weekly updates/communications to all furloughed staff via email. 

It's been over 3 months and I've gotten...4 emails. And one of them was because I had to reach out myself and ask if there were any updates because, at that point, unemployment still hadn't come through and money was really running thin.

So, there are definitely multiple companies that aren't handling the furlough very well. "
3915,Been laid off and covid 19 is making it hard to get employed.,"I think this is one of those times when you just unfortunately have to deal with unemployment until you find something. You'll probably be fine until end of July when the FPUC program (the extra $600/week) ends, but it buys you time to find suitable work, if you have no issues on your unemployment claim. I was able to find something that starts at the end of next month within a few weeks of being laid off, so I'm hoping for the best for you. "
3916,Anybody have any luck sharing info on the layoff.com site?,People on my job are active on it but I believe the quickest way to get a post brought down is by mentioning names. 
3917,Employer gave me a letter at the start of the week saying I'll likely be made redundant at the end of the week.,Sounds like a free week of being paid to me. Work at half speed 
3918,I’m pretty sure a new employee at my company got me fired. I have no idea how or what he said.,"Screw that company, just move on. You’ll look back and be glad that they did you a favor. "
3919,How likely is it that I am going to be fired?,On likert scale?? 
3920,I am a 16 year old from Colorado and I’m struggling to get a job,Have you tried McDonald’s or something? What kind of jobs are you applying to 
3921,I was told today my job doesn’t exist anymore. I had no indication that this would happen to anyone let alone me and I dont know what to do.,Get a new job. Lower standards. Quit when it doesn't fulfill your needs anymore. 
3922,Laid off then rescinded without any discussion with HR or manager - what should i do?,might be worth a call to an employment lawyer?  I do agree that was totally unprofessional of them! 
3923,How okay is it to tell your friends outside of work that your company is about to lay people off?,Why are you telling your friends? For new job leads? I wouldn’t until you’re actually laid off. 
3924,I just got confirmation that I will be fired in the upcoming weeks. How do I overcome the shame and the dreadful anxiety of this unstable future?,"tbh just get over it, soz if that sounds harsh but at the end of the day it's just a job and your first one at that, there are no shortage of opportunities for you else where, start applying and talking to recruiters and find a fresh start.

it sounds like it was your superiors fault for putting you into that position as you said they wanted some one with a bit more experience but couldn't afford it. it's their mistake not your failing. "
3925,Would it be unreasonable/too much for me to ask for a change of a title upon my lay off?,"Well Delivery/Driver sounds better than Senior Fast Food Delivery, so I might work on another title, but sure, doesn’t hurt to ask. "
3926,I just recently got laid off due to COVID cut backs and I'm nervous that I will have to uproot my family and move to another state/country. Any words of comfort or advice from anyone who has had to move for a job?,"All I can tell you is that things always (usually) have a way of working out. If you have to move, think of it as an adventure. I hate change myself, but you won’t be alone. Every time I e put myself in a situation I was uncomfortable with because of my disliking change, I felt so good after and learned new things about myself and realized sitting in your comfort zone, to might as be waiting in the lobby of death. 

Also, I was fired from my job last year (I know you were t fired) but I was, and it shook me to my core. I felt like it was the worst thing  ever. I now have a job at a dream company and I couldn’t be more grateful for the fact that I got fired. Sure I’m sure I’d have other things that I’d feel happy about if I didn’t get fired,,  but it just shows me that short of some serious tragedy, there is always opportunities when you’re experiencing issues like this! Goood luck, don’t be scared. Enjoy the riden "
3927,My director asked me for a list of my tasks. Am I getting laid off?,"I went through something like this with a large company in Denver. We had to detail how long each of our tasks took to the nearest 5 minutes and how much time we spent on each task everyday. Nobody was immediately laid off. In the long run, the company was preparing for a merger, and people weren't laid off until 18+ months later when the merger took place. 

I agree you should update your resume, but I think you should also see if you can take the opportunity to show your director how you stand out. List things like where you've made improvements to processes, or suggestions on other tasks you can take on or would be interested in. "
3928,Can severance be negotiated? (CA),It all depends on how much they want you to sign the release. You can always ask. 
3929,As a temp working for the state until the Covid-19 layoffs. I may get my position back right away. Do you have to re-apply for your old job or will you just get hired back?,"Most places just give you your old job back, unless they are restructuring or downsizing and wanting to determine who to bring back. "
3930,I’m a laid-off Recreation Manager at a high end beach resort with an open mind about my next step. Looking for suggestions.,"Skills from your experience would be customer service, managing customer experience, being a face of the high-end resort, maybe handling a team, schedules, leading training, safety?  

For $ the easiest transition would be retail, with a degree should get ur own store soon enough depending on company and covid. No less than asst manager to start. 

Sales/entrepreneurship/marketing will be hiring again soon.  Always something to sell. Acct manager, marketing manager, sales manager/analyst, etc etc. 

Conference management too, if they ever get back online and attendance bounces back. Maybe ur resort hosted some of these.

Maybe consider the training and safety route. There are a number of jobs out there, might take industry certifications or masters, but companies especially manufacturers hire these peeps to maintain/update policies and procedures to promote OSHA stuff, minimize insurance liability, ops efficiency and all. "
3931,Should I be looking for a new job now?,"I'm not sure I understood what you wanted to say there but by this ""We were also were all sold to new higher-ups about 6 months ago"" you mean your company was sold about 6 months ago and is now a subsidiary to another company? When one company buys another it's very much like an investment, they'll often reorganize the business to make it more lucrative. Sometimes that's done by closing down branches that aren't bringing in enough profits to justify their existence. But with this amount of info you know best, how are the numbers lately? How is the mood in the company, specially that of the higher ups? If things are looking bleak then I'd suggest you start looking for a new job "
3932,Getting laid off next week. How should I go about it?,Are you going to need a reference?  The world is too small to be petty here. 
3933,"I got fired for the first time, and I feel terrible","Honestly, it happens to the best of us! 

I completely understand how you feel -- I've been let go so far 5 times out of about 12 years working full time (two were store closings, the other 3 were various reasons). I'm a perfectionist at heart, was always a good student, and generally am considered a great worker despite being let go as many times as I have been.

It sucks, absolutely! However I have found that the next thing that comes along is almost always better in some way -- better people, better pay, or even a different direction in opportunity. 

Let yourself feel the emotions and work it out mentally. It will take a while. Make a list of things you're good at to remind yourself. Also be mindful of what you did well.

There are so many companies out there with ridiculous rules. I don't get it, but that's how it is sometimes. 

Also, if you were there full time, make sure you apply for unemployment! I know the systems have been overloaded but you definitely should take advantage of that if you're eligible (you likely are.)

Best of luck to you :) "
3934,"They wanted to lay me off, now they want me to change teams. Does this mean I am safe?","Why are you even thinking like this and not ""I should get a new job? "" "
3935,I was laid off but the company received a government bailout and layoffs were rescinded. What are my obligations?,"In the US, you are under no obligation to return to the job that let you go. It's a personal decision. With other job offers in play, I'd choose the job you believe will make you happy. "
3936,Am i being targeted to get laid off?,"Ok....youve received written confirmation that you are a bad worker and you are wondering if this is a bad thing?

Yes it is.  If you disagree with it, you must state this in writing to your supervisor

Just an additional tidbit, i work in consulting and there has been a huge upsurge in clients asking for help with pruning their workforce.  Some will use the pip route....so....it looks like you are on it "
3937,"Laid Off, Not Sure I Can Work 2 More Weeks","This is really hard, but I can tell you from experience that when you are applying for your next job the interviewer/manager/HR will be really interested in the experience you are gaining by training this person. Do your best to prepare them, but don’t worry about what happens to the tasks once your time is done, you don’t owe your employer anything else and you can walk away proud knowing you did what you could.

When you have spare time over the next two weeks, beef up your resume, gather information on your current role and accomplishments, touch base with coworkers and ask for help with your job search. Some employers will offer outplacement services through an employee assistance program - ask HR for any help.

When the two weeks is up don’t be hard on yourself, treat the job search like it’s your new job until you find something you want to do and take advantage of unemployment and any other services you can find - never be afraid to ask for help.


All the best. "
3938,Is my job being dissolved,I don’t think there are any plans for you to return to work.  Hopefully you’re collecting unemployment and applying elsewhere. 
3939,Teammate was fired without cause. Should we all be jumping ship?,"I would not suggest jumping ship, especially at a time like this. As someone else said already, most states are at-will meaning they can let you go and do not have to provide a reason. "
3940,"Just laid off, needs some advice.","I say to start applying in the new city. I just relocated in the middle of covid. I’m looking for jobs as well. It is not ideal, but I’m talking to people. It is never too early to start looking.

Is your move date flexible? "
3941,"Scored a full-time position with a mortgage company, but I'm worried about job security.","I have worked steadily in the mortgage business for about ten years. I have held many different positions within the industry, and I've only been laid off once, but it was in no way related to any kind of seasonal slowdown in home buying. "
3942,"Seeking Advice: My company is based in travel, just slashed my salary by 25% for 4 months, and has laid off people in other departments. Is it time to start looking?","Sounds like a good idea, I would probably start looking personally if I were in that situation. Even if you do not find anything, it would be good practice. That is one good way to address complacency. "
3943,Only a high school diploma but 8 years of experience. How hard is this going to be for me?,"Hey there, I posted this to someone else who was asking a similar question so felt it may be helpful for you as well: 

I don’t have a degree and I don’t code either but I earn six figures at a FAANG company as a manager. It has taken me about 6-7 years to get to this point though. Just hustle, try not to bring college up, learn as much as you can prior to the interview about the company, the skills required, technical knowledge required, and learn about the people you are interviewing with so you can try to have a good conversational interview with an understanding of their backgrounds too. DM me if you need help or advice. If you feel confident you can do the role, try not to use “quick learner” or “eager” or “hard working”, let that come through in your answers, use the STAR (situation, task, action, result..impact for bonus points) method to answer questions in an organized, clear, concise way.

Also, here is a resource spreadsheet myself and a couple others created and that will continue to get updated as much as possible. There are tabs for unemployment resources, job sites, charities/emergency funds, online communities, and more. It also just got updated with a “companies hiring” tab that is pretty detailed!

**Link to resource spreadsheet:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQZDDXCWJ1-2Hu-yLBBeEculJSzpk1ZwAMdi-nGCcVtAAVvsG4-EBKOCOHn2puS6MmAiIwRM72ne-49/pubhtml# 

Also, if you're not already a part of it, **join the r/unemployed Discord server!** We are working to build it out and provide as many resources, tools, and support as possible during this tough time. **Link for Discord:** https://discord.gg/nQgyF4g

**If you join the Discord server please make sure to react to the #rules channel in order to gain full access.**

Good luck. Hope this helps a bit. "
3944,Writing a letter to employer to re-hire an employee?,"If you can somehow submit it anonymously, I would say go for it but don't get your hopes up. Do you know why your manager got laid off outside of the reason they told you? There may be information you don't know. I wouldn't recommend sticking your neck out for someone if you can't do it anonymously. "
3945,am i getting laid off?,"You could be getting laid off, yes, there’s no way to know for sure. "
3946,On standby and just found job listing for my position,"The writing is on the wall - I suggest applying to other jobs ASAP. Same thing happened to me this summer, saw an ad for my exact position on indeed and got cut loose two weeks later. "
3947,My job laid me off with severence but is changing their minds and asking me to work for one more week to earn my severance pay. what do I do?,"People forget that when you get laid off, they can still expect you to be at work for the next two weeks.  

Most companies are afraid of the potential damage you could and just say go home but they are within their rights to ask you to come in "
3948,"Laid off and denied unemployment, where to look?",It's probably not the ideal solution but student loans for living expenses might be an option. It's not a path I would normally recommend but these are not normal times 
3949,Can I ask for pay stubs after I have been let go?,"You are entitled to them, so yes, you can ask. Call the service desk & they will create a case for an HR/Human Capital agent to fulfill. Give them 72 hours, then call back for a status on your ticket, assuming they haven't already emailed you an incident resolution, stating that they have dropped these in the mail to you. "
3950,In a temporary lay off situation is it advisable to update my LinkedIN to state I am Open to New Opportunities?,"I am in a similar situation. Was temporarily laid-off due to COVID-19 however, my prior company stated they are doing what they can to weather the storm of this pandemic and once things are on the upswing, they are going to reach back out to us for rehire. As much as I have high hopes for this, I also realize I cannot wait months on end for my position to open back up, if it even does. Life goes on, we have a living we have to sustain, and the one person we need to have the best interest out for is *ourselves*. This pandemic is perfect example that there are companies out there that will drop you in an instant to save themselves.

As much as companies are adamant about saying they want to hire their workforce back after this pandemic clears, you have to remember ***nothing is guaranteed unless it is in a signed and acknowledged contract***. Unless your separation papers from the company states there is a specific month/date you are due to be hired back on or even talks about a promise of being brought back on, you need to realize you are 100% done with that company. You are not legally tied and employed by that company anymore so you are not obligated to act any particular way toward them.

In the meantime start updating your resume and looking for opportunities (while also following your state's orders during this pandemic of course) You can begin your search on LinkedIn without having to blatantly advertise you are 'seeking new opportunities' (there are features on there where you can turn off updates to your network if you have to update/edit anything)

Once this pandemic is done, I think a lot of people are going to get burned by empty promises from their former employers if in the event they can't hire 100% of their original workforce back. "
3951,Has anyone had the good fortune of getting a job that put you in charge of the person that fired or laid you off?,"I had to fire my old boss he didn't fire or lay me off but he was a bad leader. 

Don't take business personal it makes your life easier. "
3952,"during one of my summers at university I was fired from a job for a very unfair reason, I am now a graduate looking for full time work and I really do not want this affecting me, can employers find out that I had been previously fired without a reference call?","Probably not without calling your former employer.

You can always pretend you're a hiring agent and call your former company to see how they are presenting your situation. Most companies are pretty limited in how they speak of former workers. Some might just state your departure date only. Or ""he was let go"". "
3953,How do I know I’ve been temporarily laid off or actually fired? Haven’t gotten any word...,">A few weeks ago in March I was called by an employee I’m close to and was told “not to come in until you hear otherwise”

This person could be lying. Sounds like you are still in a job. HR department usually email/call you. "
3954,Paycuts and new jobs,"Im really surprised to see as many ads as I am currently seeing - obviously a lot of this was pre-arranged, pre-scheduled, pre-paid - but it really doesn't matter how many times I see your mint cell phone ads, your subaru ads, your stitch fix ads - if I have no job, if I have no income, if I don't know what the world is going to look like in 60 days, 90 days, if I don't know if i'll be homeless in the next 6 months - Im probably not going out and spending any ""new money"" right now ..  

Anyway - back to your question - your company is downsizing / cutting pay / etc - hundreds of other marketing companies will be going through the same changes  ..  

There is no magic answer right now - check back when covid dies down a bit  

Maybe spend some time in /r/smallbusiness or /r/entrepreneur or so on - maybe it's time to start up your own thing - start marketing for the small local companies who have switched to making PPE equipment for front line workers in this time of crisis/shortage/etc  

Start celebrating the smaller unsung heros that are doing everything they can to better their communities right now "
3955,I was laid off this morning. The company has encouraged me to reach out with any questions I might have when I’m ready. What should I ask?,"Ask for outplacement assistance!! Please do this as it typically includes career coaching, resume writing and various job search strategies. "
3956,Pending Layoff - Suggestions?,[deleted] 
3957,Laid off after four months,Please provide more information. Was this your first management job? We’re you promoted into this position? Would it benefit your resume if you do put this position on your resume (i.e. was this a job in a field you were trying to break into)? 
3958,"Just got laid off, did not see it coming, what is the next step?","So you are laid off and didn't get walked out immediately?   
It's unlikely they will give you a lot of details on the reasons. Probably restructuring or obsolete role.   
But it's important to stay professional and don't sign anything. If they pressure you to sign, take the document and say you'll read it over and get it back to them.   
Don't burn any bridges as it might come back to bite you. They might just want to know your state of mind so it's not a liability if you are distraught and go do something when you leave.  
Just remember that it has nothing to do with you and they are losing a valuable employee.

Oh, I see I am late to the party since this was posted yesterday...so how did it go? "
3959,Starting to feel I will be fired soon,File for unemployment even if you quit. You can later do a seasonal job then re-open your claim and draw on it after being laid off from the seasonal job. 
3960,I lost my job yesterday,[deleted] 
3961,Is it smart for the boss to fire someone simply because they believe someone isn’t happy?,"In the short term, employers are better able to call the shots.  With more people out until things get back to normal, which may take a little time, or maybe not, the applicant pool will be increased.  With more people desperate for a job, there will be more people willing to take a job for less money.  Why throw more money to try to keep you when there's someone out there more than willing to take your spot for less money?  This will be the sad reality for the next few months when businesses start hiring again. Don't expect everything to just suddenly go back to normal. "
3962,How to change my career?,"My thoughts are with you. I changed careers from music to finance at age 30 and just got laid off last week.  


It takes courage to switch careers - maybe you could move diagonally to a sort of sales role in the industry so it's not such a huge transition? "
3963,Company went through layoffs. Now the people that are left are ‘working through their severance period’,Start looking for a damned job. Do it and go to interviews. Yes you are being played 
3964,My job layed off everyone only to hire us in a different temporary position!,"Basically, you lost your job. The company you worked for is offering you another job. It is up to you whether you want to take that other job or not. "
3965,Help Please. What can I do to encourage a person not to give up when it comes to finding a job?,Why were they jealous? And how did he/she know they were jealous? It sounds like she was let go because of the corona virus 
3966,Going to be put on a second PIP - advice on next steps!,"I was in a similar situation except they just fired me before implementing the pip when I seemed committed to it...

When I started to realize my job was on the line, I started making the kinds of mistakes I never made before. When your job is at risk, it affects your mental health, which affects the quality of your work. This is especially true if you care about the work you do or it's a large part of your identity.

My biggest mistake was putting my head down and working harder, when I should have taken more time to work on myself. If you have access, I'd highly recommend seeing a therapist while you have benefits, so this doesn't happen again. I don't know you, but I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that you're not suited to your chosen profession. "
3967,My company is downsizing and I am being retained. What questions do I need to ask my employers?,"> Both my boss and the CFO have assured me that I am essential and absolutely needed for the transition and beyond. 

Honestly...do you believe that?

What’s more important is to know your own worth. You should be assessing the company during this period. What’s your ambition? Does the companies ambition and goals align with yours? Have you grown there? Do you trust that the current leadership can deliver on goals/vision?

You should be asking questions of yourself. "
3968,Need Advice emailing the CEO!,"You're naive to think the world revolves around you. Take your experience, apply it elsewhere. "
3969,Lost my first full-time office job yesterday and want some help,"I would definitely put the position in your CV with no time-frame. I would explain what I did and how I did and I would explain to any prospective recruiters/employers that you were happy there and they were happy with you, however as it was a start-up they had to make some budget-cuts/layoffs. Be honest about it. Be enthusiastic about working in the field and if you are then you will definitely be hired. 

I wouldn't worry too much about courses, any popular high-demand ones I would take if I could but the normal online ones are normally no value. 

I wouldn't hurry. Think about your direction in life and what you want to accomplish for the next 10 years. Do you see yourself in retail or marketing? Do you see yourself in a different field. It is always easy to change a job, however building up is hard. You normally need years of experience for high-level positions so if you liked marketing and you want to do marketing in the future then you should try and get into marketing or a similar sounding role - PR for example. I know it will be though for a few weeks/months but stick it out and apply for any marketing jobs. It might be even worth getting a below market value with 1-2k per year but staying there for 1-2 years so you can build experience.

About the health insurance - are you in the US? If so then I can't help as I'm UK based. Ask maybe a friend or a relative that has experienced unemployment at some point. Surely you're not the only one ever to be layed off. 

5. I got layed off a position during my 8th month there. It was a bit sad but it was absolute hell to work for them. They killed my joy in work and it was a blessing in disguise. I now work for a letting agency (property sector), which is what I wanted to work as for a long time but was not really qualified to do so yet.

How I do deal with the issue in the present and prepare for the future..,"I'll tell you what my first boss told me the first time I made a HUGE mistake that almost cost me my job. If you have a concern about yourself that you fear may cost you something important talk to your manager/boss/lead/whoever is in charge and tell them how your feeling followed with the question, ""Can you help me make a plan where I can be successful?"" 
Not only did I use this in a future job, but I've had my managers give me praise for being honest with them. "

3974,Ghosted by my boss,"This happened to me with my first ever employer and I too was nervous about confronting them. Great piece of advice from my Pops finally gave me the courage to confront them: “...if they’re going to put you in an awkward position regarding money that’s rightfully yours, you have no reason to feel awkward bluntly asking for it...” or, something like that. Forget the texting and show up in person for the money you worked for. "
3975,Question about lay-off,apply for unemployment 
3976,Update: my boss told me today that I oversold myself in the interview: I got fired yesterday.,"Well, at least have experience now :) just look at it as a stepping stone job for a bigger and better position. I come from a medium sized bank and the manager there  would set up people for failure and have her minions ""log"" everything for her so she could take it to HR and get that person fired. I ended up walking out and now have been hired at a huge bank with better pay. Everything happens for a reason. "
3977,"Should I tell people I was ""laid off"" or that I ""transitioned out?""","I was laid off due to budget cuts (and my level of seniority and recency hired.) I tell people bluntly when I was hired, months later the company lost revenue and couldn't afford me. So my position was eliminated. 

I also asked them for a recommendation before I left which I provide if anyone has questions. "
3978,Terminated from job after 4 weeks because of “lack of fit”,"Is NYC an “At Will” entity? I live in an At Will state and have been in management for two decades and I’ve seen a lot of these lack of fit terminations. That deobligates any need for a real reason. As long as they have documentation on their end, even if you weren’t aware of it. It’s a pretty shitty excuse for the employer. "
3979,Help understanding my new position,"Just tell him you will take the offer for now but that you can't afford to live long on reduced wages and that you will be searching for new employment. 

What is the winter market like in your area? If you are sure you can find new employment quickly then it shouldn't be a problem. If it is getting slow everywhere due to winter, then you might really want to consider the deal he is offering. "

>What should I do? Should I hold on to this weekend position until I find another job?

There's no real reason to quit if you're only working weekends.  Being free on weekdays leaves you plenty of time to apply and interview other places. Personally I'd stay, just to keep some income, until you find a better position. "

3989,I think my boss might fire me unfairly,"I'd consult with a lawyer, on your own time and using your own personal phone/computer/email account, etc.

Don't tell your employer anything about the lawyer. If your manager finds out, she will likely retaliate (which is illegal, but very common, BTW). If you need to assert your legal rights, have your lawyer do it for you.

Stay positive and professional at work. Do what you are instructed to the best of your ability.

Document everything for your lawyer while looking for another job. "
3990,My friend/coworker warned me that I might get fired and there was a complaint filed against me.,"Seen this once, my advice: Make it big, blow it up.

Sometimes you truly see the nature of people. If she really filed a complaint describing you as: ' incompetent, I am unproductive and I provide no value to the company' then misuse her own complaint against her.(of course wait for the complaint to become official). These words are enough for a person to feel insulted and misused.

Here's what's I'd do:

\- Ask for a 1-on-1 conversation with your higher-up.- Describe the need for her to 'explain' to you what her complain was about.

Now comes the fun part. If you do your job correctly, then she has nothing to say about you unless it directly involves her. And you as a person are going to, maturely, make this big:

\- Trust: You as a person have been insulted and won't undergo this. You are going to exploit this as hard as possible, let the company know that trust for you is a serious requisite and this damages any future involvement with the colleague.

\- 'Knowing your place:' She doesn't have much direct involvement with you but does complaint about you. Ask her what the direct cause was of this. She's gonna have to answer with 'Well in the last 3 weeks we worked on...', if she can't describe an actual situation causing this complaint then she's... well she's fucked. (Did someone else ask her to?)

All her wrongdoings and everything fishy you will write down... in your own complaint against her. Make her bleed. "
3991,Working for a company that started layoffs. Should I start looking?,"Time to start looking NOW. It's a downward spiral: morale goes down, the best/most talented people start to quit, there's staff meetings where management lies to everyone, then more layoffs, etc. "
3992,I got fired for the first time in my life today 3 weeks into the position,"This wasn't your fault. It was theirs. They advertised and hired for the wrong position. I've had that happen. Years ago I was hired to be a web project manager for a marketing department. Five months into the job they realized they needed another content person that could do QA not a PM. 

I tried to tell the manager that 3 months into the job. So I wasn't surprised when they eventually killed the PM position and reposted it for a different job title and description. "
3993,Just got laid off. Negotiating severance & job market at end of year,"There is no ""standard"" unless there is a standard in your employee handbook. I doubt there is.

You really don't have any leverage unless they are asking you to sign a full release and there's something they really want to be released from.

If they are offering you only 6 weeks, you don't have anything they are afraid of. They don't have to offer you anything barring a union agreement or something in the handbook. "

3999,Job redundancy in Australia,"I suggest browsing the Fair Work Commission website for some procedural guides. Also, check the employment agreement of each employee you are thinking of laying off or restructure their job description. Treat people with respect, negotiate with them and encourage them to seek better opportunities elsewhere. There is nothing worse than getting the company into employment disputes. "

No.  Don't talk to your new manager.  He's not going to change his mind.  He's got his own ideas on how he wants to run the place and he's already put those in place.  You already know from what you've seen that you definitely not a big part of it.  Start finding a new job if you haven't. "
4005,Can you get another job after getting fired from a retail company?,"Well, that might be the issue.  You basically told them it’s their fault you’re not doing well when you highlighted a lack of training.  Regardless, if it’s only been a couple of months you got hired there with a gap in your resume so I’m sure you can be successful at doing that again. "
4006,"~50 year old, laid off recently.","Tell your mom to call her county works department, many counties offer free skills training and free job placement assistance ( if her county doesn't, have her call the state department of human services to see if they have suggestions )

www.udemy.com has a bunch of discounts active right now ( these are not accredited courses, so beware in paying for something that an employer may consider 'useless' ) "
4007,Getting Laid Off Soon! In Need of Career Advice!,"You do the math:  if your 3 months + bonus = more than 6 months of income, you can wait.  This assumes it will take you 6 months to land a job if you start looking the day after you leave.  6 months is my general guideline.

If, however, you find a sure thing and they want you to start the day before d day, you look at the benefits of having a firm offer in hand, the income, etc. vs the severance (the day before the last day is a ridiculous scenario, but it’s what I use to evaluate an offer).

So, a month or two out:  start looking and applying for a job.  Call contacts and see who is hiring and will they hire you the day after you leave.

If you can arrange for this, it is the best of all worlds.

/a coworker got a job about 2 months before d-day.  However, her manager allowed her to “flex” work from home.  As such, she reaped the severance and had a job prior to d-day.   This is the true ideal scenario if you can arrange it.

Best of luck. "
4008,How do I make recruiters stop talking to me?,"Memorise this sentence: ""Sorry, ik begrijp je niet."" 

Any other language (apart from English) would work as well.. "
4009,Weird layoff situation that kinda bugs me. Thoughts?,"This is a hard pill to swallow but at the end of the day, companies are going to do what is in THEIR best interest. Even if that means letting go someone who is likable or who has been an excellent performer. I was laid off from my prior job last May and was considered a ""top performer"" in my group. When my boss served me my notice she was in literal tears since the decision was out of her hands and everyone knew I was an essential key performer to the team but they still let me go. 

You were fortunate to survive this wave of layoffs. For the next one? Who knows. Generally when a company starts doing layoffs, it is not a great sign for the company financially. When there is one wave of layoffs, you can expect another to come down the road. 

What toughened my skin with jobs nowadays is any company is capable of replacing you within a heart beat. Vice versa as well, employees do not owe anything to a company except for the exchange of skills for money to get the job done. It is all a mutually agreed upon transaction. If you look at today's workforce in that mindset it will make you feel much less emotionally invested with it. Not to say you shouldn't care about your coworkers but that is just the reality of it. "
4010,My mom unexpectedly lost her job today. My brother and I are in college. What can/should I do?,"You can start by getting a part time job and paying for more things yourself. Take a look at your finances and ask yourself, what do I pay and what does my family pay? Shift the burden from your parents to yourself. Don't forget that your parents financial burden is their own and as a college student, there isn't much you can do about it except carry more of your own weight. "
4011,What should I say about me being laid off?,"I have been laid off twice now.  Once from a startup that decided to pivot, and very much needed to, and another when a contract role ended.  There is no shame in it, it happens frequently, just tell them why.  I'm sure you've heard this before, just don't slander your former employer.  It's easy to be bitter but it's generally not personal just business.  Interviews I have had after these experiences, when I have been unemployed, most interviewers didn't even ask about it. "
4012,Terrified by a massive layoff at work,[deleted] 
4013,Position eliminated after working for company for one month,Just know you got that job so you can certainly get another! You certainly may want to leave that most recent job off your resume. 
4014,Out of work after 14 years,"Just had this happen to me after 13 years at same company. Most others laid off found other positions  in the company, but not me. I posted on FB and had a lot of people looking out for me and networking for me. My last day was June 21st and I start my new job tomorrow. A few things I realized. Even if you don’t think you qualify, apply anyways. I paid somebody to spruce up my resume and I had lots of positive feedback about it. I bought two new suits and I think that helped me feel like a million bucks in interviews.  There is no such thing as overselling your qualities. If you are good at something, you are very good at it. Odds are, you’re going to have to take a pay cut, so make sure you get hired at a company that has good promotion opportunities. I switched my mindset from how much am I going to make, to how much can I save for retirement. And...I took some time to mourn the loss of my good job. Good luck, I’m sure you will land something quickly. "
4015,What does a employment termination conversation sound like? Someone at work got fired and it went over really quick,"I got fired last week, they basically told me how I wasn't performing well, then said I had failed the probation because I wasn't suited to the role, they spent 40 minutes critiquing my performance before they said they were terminating my employment "
4016,My coordinator was let go and management has pretty much insinuated that I am not to reach out to her. I want to help and let her know I'd be a reference.,I assume this policy is aimed at reducing liability for the company. Treat is as a personal reference and then you're serving both needs to protect the company and help your friend 
4017,I was laid off by a company actively committing fraud. Should I pull the trigger?,Do it!  
4018,Can a Company Lay You Off Then Take It Back?,Bied your time and keep looking for a new job.....the company is just buying time until he could find a subcontractor that will work so you should do the same thing 
4019,"If I get salary continuation as apart of layoffs, am I technically still ‘employed’ when applying to other jobs","I would say it depends.  In my experience, I have seen it where people say on Linkedin they are still employed by the company even though they were laid off and are getting paid via salary continuation or a severance.  Technically, they are not employed anymore, but most people do this to avoid a gap.  From my perspective, its a technicality.  I would probably just leave Linkedin alone and continue to job hunt as if I still have my job. "

4027,Does this count as being fired?,"Art is a hard field, you will really need to understand marketing to be able to sell your skills to clients and show how much you are worth or create cool products people want to buy. A food related job no body really cares about, and once you figure out freelancing you won't even need a resume anymore so I wouldn't worry about. (I freelance as a book illustrator, do my clients care I used to work in retail? No, why would they?) You will need to take jobs to stay a float, no shame in that, just keep building up your portfolio and find other people with interests like yourself, often they will be both your support and perhaps future clients. You will need to put yourself out there and offer value to people, then people will start to trust you and help support you as best they can. Go to meetups, say yes to opportunities, and say thank you and keep going. It's a really hard road, but it gets a little easier with time.  


It took me a year to get out of retail and I'm still not that super stable with 5 clients I've had for months. I'd recommend saving up as much as you can before starting freelancing because it's hard to make money freelancing but it's possible, just need to wear a lot of hats, and be very comfortable with high risk, you are running a business and it's easy to find it overwhelming sometimes, but my schedule is so flexible it feels really worth it. I can offer you some advice on marketing and social media, and work with you to present yourself a little better if you like. I don't have a degree in art, so you already are a step up on certain job positions. I don't have a lot of time but I can offer a little if you are serious about freelancing, for free even. "

4030,Fired from corporate job after 3 months without warning or reason. Was unemployed for 6mo prior. Where to go from here?,"Same thing happened to me, I leave the job off my resume (was there for about 2.5 mo) and when asked about the gap I just say it was a job that didn’t work out, and I move on. As long as you have good references and the company you’re interviewing with isn’t overly nosy about why you left this position, it shouldn’t matter. "
4031,Why aren't two-weeks notices a thing when firing someone?,"Because, there is a risk associated with a staff that is forcefully will leave the company. There is a ton of data and damage that an employee can do before they leave.

A good company mitigates these risks by giving employees ample time to realise what is happening before this.

If it's behavioural, then they would be warned by write ups, PIP, HR meetings and more. 

If it's contractual, then giving people time to prepare 'off the books' conversation to prepare the person. "

4034,Why did you get fired and how can you help others learn from your mistake?,"Never be a pushover, own your mistakes, be flexible with feedback but at the same time always speak up if you feel mistreated.

My last job was just till work as a sales assistant first job ever, had bare 4 minute training which of course I made couple mistakes as I wasn't ringing money at the right value or having trouble voiding transactions because my boss put so many stupid limitations on the tills because I was just seasonal. 

Things changed for the better when I spoke up as you can't expect me to do a good job if I need senior authorisation every 5 mins, then got my notice the day before the shop was meant to clear stock so I was just used as the one guy sat on tills all Christmas period. Most of it is just water under the bridge now. "

4036,Company going bankrupt have 4 days till I'm unemployed what do I do?,"Look up how to file for unemployment and do that ASAP.  Also ask about cobra and explore healthcare options.  Schedule any doctors appointments you need in the next four days and get prescriptions refilled if needed.  After that, prepare your resume and start applying for jobs.  You can also try the temp agency route as data entry jobs are easy to find as a temp.  You can do this to hold you over. "

4039,"Put on performance improvement plan, did EVERYTHING outlined but was still fired.","What state are you in? In all but Montana (I think?) employment is at will, so your employer can technically fire you for basically any reason. Minus retaliation, discrimination, or something like that.

Two days later, his entire team was also fired.   


In his case, I've been helping with support. Had I not been around, he'd probably get the fastest job he could (I'm talking retail, barista, etc.) to keep the lights on until he got something closer to his profile and full time.

I have stuck it out for the time being. There have been redundancies although I believe all voluntary up to now. We were discussing this at the team meeting and they have kept it below 20 so the company hasn’t had to consult on it. This means they can do the same in 3 months time. A new finance director has been put in place and he is there to cut the fixed costs so it’s highly likely there will be further cuts based on what he is reported to have been saying to people. I am currently doing an online course that I feel could substantially improve my CV so I am trying to complete that as soon as possible and then I will start looking properly. I am still not sure moving somewhere else would make me any better of with the current uncertainties of Brexit.

4057,"Is it unethical to say you are still employed at an old company, if you were recently fired from that company, but they said they will give you a clean reference?","Potential employers will ask them for employment dates (if nothing else, they ask for employment dates,) and it will definitely not go in your favor.  They will give a clean reference, but they won't lie and say you're still an employee. "
4058,Meeting with the Bobs coming,"You've already admitted you don't do much, so expect that both the scalpel and the ax are going to get you. Find a way to fill your day or expect to be fired. "

4062,Given a Performance Improvement Plan,"Sorry, I've read through this and don't see what the question actually is? You've told a story and then asked advice.  "
4063,Have you ever kept a job after stating unfair dismissal?,"About 7-8 years ago I was working for a company with blatant misconduct happening regularly, although I was treated well. I had a coworker who ended up being a good friend of mine, but was just awful at his job. his sales were low and he showed some new hires how little he was making. Of course that caused them to doubt the prospects of the job, and my boss who everyone despised fired him for it. 

On the low, I referred him to the labor division who filed a complaint that he was fired for discussing wages. Basically it was an open and shut case as multiple people witnessed it and were fully cooperating with the investigation.

The company offered him either his job back or something like $20,000. Incredibly, he took his job back. I guess he thought he would be retaliated against and could pursue this further, well he was wrong. He just continued to not be good and hate the job until he quit. 

I wouldn’t recommend it, once the ties are cut it’s over. "
4064,Running into the manager who laid you off,"It’s business, not friendship. Just treat them like a business associate and you had a business deal go wrong.

Don’t hold bad blood, but don’t waste time taking to them "
4065,"I think I got fired, but I'm not sure.",Call the number. And unemployment is your best bet. 
4066,"Laid off yesterday from first job after college, already have two interviews for jobs I applied to several weeks ago. Do I tell my potential employers about the layoff?","Only if asked. Then you can simply state that the role wasn’t for you and describe how the current job is. They may be satisfied if you just say it wasn’t the role for you, but they’ll be more satisfied if you can successfully differentiate between the job that didn’t work out and the one that you’re interviewing for.  "
4067,Layoff or Severance package?,"Why not look for jobs, and if he doesn’t land one, take the severance? If he has time, he can be picky. "
4068,Finance department is being outsourced - probably will lose my job freaked out about next steps,Can't believe its been a month already I appreciate the responses.  I'm hanging on for now (we have the consultants coming in at the end of the month for training before we formally hand over our processes to them).   My objective is to get a severance package since they offer 3 weeks for every year of service (been with the company 10 years).  Then I'll take some time off to travel then come back and do some full force job hunting.  Wish my luck yall 
4069,Would you post a bad Glassdoor review?,"If the company just sucks, probably not. But if they're really, *really* bad, or the managers/supervisors/etc were massive assholes, absolutely. "
4070,How to explain getting fired for attendance?,
4071,Current job has technical problems where I can’t work. No sign of when it is going to be fixed,I would explain the situation and let them know about the changes. I think it's more responsible to address that ahead of time instead of surprising them and having that scheduling conflict. 
4072,"My employer has stopped paying me due to lack of funds, but they say I am not laid off. What’s the best way to handle this situation?","Report them to your state department of labor.  Then get them to lay you off so you can collect unemployment.  Or, file unemployment and force them to fight the claim. "
4073,Just got laid off. Need some advice updating the resume of a digital marketer.,Seems like you are new to marketing. Why don't you list what you have been doing and the tools used from your last job ? 
4074,Trying to get back into my past company,"Standard approach. Employers will find anyway to DQ you, legal or not.

I guess my question to you though is this: why work for a company that laid you off? I'd leave them entirely, and bring my expertise elsewhere where it's valued.  "
4075,Should i ride it out for potential redundancy pay or leave now?,
4076,"Made redundant, help!","This is, at this point, *purely* a math question: how long can you last with the one month severance and your savings (and any other safety net you might have), and how long do you think it’ll take you to find a job (and double the time you think it’ll take to be safe)? You know your field, market, and qualifications much better than we do, so I’m not sure anyone here will be able to help you with this question.  "
4077,Should I let an employee work after they know they will be fired?,"Depends.  Its not uncommon to have people continue to work after being fired with the promise that the supervisor will give them a good reference.  

Just because they were a bad worker at one particular company, doesnt mean they will be a bad worker at every company "
4078,Got fired today (once again) I'm not sure how to improve,"First, they want you to take initiative. If you see something that doesn't look right, you can raise it and give an idea of how to fix it. Let your boss agree to your solution, or suggest another one (they typically have a better idea of how to solve an issue, given their exposure to the wider org). This shows that you are taking initiative and want to solve problems. That is the first level.  

The next level is whether you are active affirmatively to prevent problems. We call this working proactively. So, if you are in a work environment and you see a risk, or a threat, you should proactively put some control/measure in place to prevent it. 

Now, here is the interesting part \- and this is KEY. It is not enough to just prevent. You have to articulate what you did and why to your boss. Otherwise, he/she won't know. The reason s/he won't know is b/c you are playing defense. Defensive players never get the glory and are only given attention when things go wrong. So, part of your problem with this may be that you aren't vocal about making it known, or including your boss, that you are implementing some control to prevent scenario x from happening.  "
4079,Suspension/resignation advice,"On the face of it, I’d just resign first thing and not go through whatever bullshit kangaroo court they have planned for you. "
4080,My department is being laid-off- what are the questions I need to be asking?,"They are giving you a run way. You either take off and become one of the sociopaths. Or crash and burn back into mediocrity.

Do it ! Make a 30 60 90 and regular check ins. Create a system to track your work for review time. 

This has happened to me a few times it’s a great opportunity for those who want autonomy and can create results.  "

4085,"Got fired, do I need to personally deliver the company's property back?","Until you get your final check i would retain the equipment.
It's a bargaining position in case they try and screw you in some manner.
Best of luck going forward  "
4086,Just got fired but I can’t leave the office?,Have you asked your boss as to why you need to stay?  Tell him you have recording of him firing you and leave.  Unless he answers that this is technically a layoff and there is a package involved or a do not compete. 
4087,Being paid to walk away from a job...should I?,"Take the buyout.  Then focus on finding a stable gig.  The cash infusion buys you flexibility.

Don't do like other people I've known who turned it down... continued working away and ended up getting nothing but a kick in the ass when the company went bankrupt shortly thereafter. "
4088,"Fired from job within probationary period. Was offered a two-month contract that was supposed to allow me to work from home while seeking new employment. Boss has hit me with two huge, complicated, weird projects. What to do?","Who gave you the projects?  The guy that fired you or the guy that couldn't sleep the night it happened?  If it came from #1, maybe #2 can help give you direction?  I agree with u/runs_in_the_jeans.  Do the best you can. "
4089,Reason to believe layoffs are coming. I'm a recent hire and this is my first non-entry level job in the field.,"Layoffs can happen in several forms:  least valued employee is let go, last hired is let go, or everyone is let go.

If everyone is let go, there is nothing you can do to prevent it.  Think:  they close the plant/office


If it’s “last hired is first fired”, that’s bad for you, but prevented if you prove too valuable to fire.

Same for least valued employee.

To position yourself into being to valueable to fire, you have to up your contribution and value to your group, office, plant, company.

Do this by working your rear end off and being super productive.  If it takes everyone else 4 hours to turn an assignment around, you do it in one.

You might find yourself studying corporate structures late and after hours.  Do so without complaining.  

Also:  look for internal jobs you qualify for and consider applying for them

If it’s only a regional issue, you would move to a safer spot.

Lastly, start building industry contacts so if you are cut, you can land somewhere else quickly. "

4092,How to find out if my company is going to lay off one of it's call centers soon?,Did the other departments get laid off before the work began on the building? I mean it's entirely possible the property owner is just taking advantage of the vacancy to upgrade the facility to make it more attractive to another company to move in to the open areas. 
4093,Second time getting laid off in less than two years. Is this poor reflection on me?,"In science, unfortunately it is normal, especially if your work is grant-based. Happened to me earlier in my career. "
4094,"After 6 months of starting a position in a new department, I am being forced out.","It seems as the new manager is impatient with you, unwilling to invest the time or energy into bringing you up to his/her standards, and is telling you to go back to where you were or prepare to be fired.

No, they aren’t going to train you.  They expect you to either learn it on your own or get out.

In the future, when you are in a job you are over your head in, be sure to learn as much as you can as fast as you can any way you can.   It’s that initiative that will keep you employed.  No, I can’t give you an answer on how to do this other than to say your survival depends on it and when you realize this, you figure out answers to the problems and questions. "
4095,Should I stay at this job or quit? Would I get unemployment in this scenario?,I was at the previous job for quite some time and worked from January 2018 halfway through October 2018 before taking this new job in November and have worked it since.  
4096,I got fired and I am lost / happy (?),
4097,Am I About to Get Fired?,"Ideally, you would have been checking in with your boss more and getting more feedback about how you are progressing in the role. Your boss is also to blame for not initiating this.

Things don't sound good, to be honest. On Monday, if you don't get fired, you need to have a very frank conversation with your boss. Does she realistically believe you can fix your performance issues? This conversation is not going to CAUSE her to fire you, so it's better for you to know.

It will be okay, no matter what happens. I can tell you are a dedicated employee from your post. This might just not be the best fit. "

4099,Can you put a price on job security?,"I hate to break it to you, but there is no such thing as job security. You should also know that hiring trends these days mean that its quite normal to be looking and interviewing for 3-6 months unless you know someone who can bypass this for you.

Look after yourself. Start looking, but remember there is no such thing as job security.

4102,"Paranoid about layoffs - payroll looking at my LinkedIn profile, is this a bad sign?",There's an equal likely-hood that the payroll employee checking you out is just as worried about layoffs and is seeing what their fellow employees are doing about it. 
4103,Is there any sort of situation where it’s subtly harmful to ask your boss about your job security?,"Well, it does make it seem like you don’t think your job is integral to the organization if you ask. I doubt it’d make your boss decide they don’t need you, though. 

That said, there’s really no benefit to asking this question. If your job is in jeopardy, they’re unlikely to tell you before the scheduled plan. "
4104,How to know if your job is at risk?,"They are not being honest with you. It’s likely because of their numbers. Paying you more is not going to make their numbers look better. Or if things are really bad, it could be as you suspect. 

What they’re doing is wrong. But you’ve brought it up more than once and they keep blowing you off. You are going to have to press the issue to higher ups or leave this job.  "

4106,"So how do I get a job at a fast food restaurant (McDonalds, Wendys, etc)?","They will probably tell you to apply online anyway. Go to the restaurant's website and click under ""careers"" and submit your resume and cover letter (if you want). In terms of writing a resume, when I was younger I used websites where you insert the info and it makes up a resume for you and found that was a good place to start because it gives you good examples of relevant information to put via a dropdown menu. You can google ""fast food restaurant resumes"" to get a good idea of what to put - because your young and probably don't have the experience, focus on the skills section. Fast food and retail places usually just want someone punctual, reliable and hardworking. Apply to MANY places. They definitely don't mind if you don't have experience but you will usually get one interview every 30 applications or so regardless. Try using keywords from the job posting in your resume. I started applying for jobs when I was 15 but didn't get one until I turned 16, so don't be discouraged. "
4107,"People who work at a car washing place, I’m about to start and I don’t know what to expect, what’s training like? What will I have to do? Is it hard?",They will train you. You'll be ok. Congrats on your new job. 
4108,Job at a firm vs family startup,"Tough, but personally I would go with the firm. There's two main reasons for this:

1. Working with family blurs lines - I can't speak to what your relationship with your dad is like, but there's a risk that your arguments with your father at home might look similar in the workplace. Some things exchanged between the two of you might not fly if he wasn't your dad. 

2. Possibility of stunted professionalism -  Being able to be sociable with strangers, clients and coworkers, and learning to work in a team with your coworkers (even the ones you don't like) is incredibly valuable. I would worry about not being properly socialized if your only team mate is your dad. 

Is money a big issue for you? If it is, I'd say definitely the firm. 

Would it be possible for you to join in at a later stage of his startup? Or join occasionally as a ""consultant""? Or if you end up hating the firm, could you go back to your dads startup as a fallback? "

4112,Signs a Startup is Failing?,"Hey, you work at the same place I used to work in 2016!  Our international clients just don't have the same frivolous requirements as Americans, like TLS encryption, using internal password combinations other than root/password1234, and mobile first (or ever) app design.

I was offered a position with a large share of equity and good pay, but paid as a contractor until we could afford to make make me a real employee.  As the others have confirmed, it's a good time to find a new job. "
4113,Are these valid concerns?,"Yes, your concerns are valid. Usually nonprofits pay less than other jobs (because they don't have profits to pay people with), so it is a bit surprising if you're getting $20k more with great benefits. Take it and reap the gains while it lasts if it makes for your situation; sometimes challenging situations are the best learning opportunities. "
4114,Questions for an interview with a startup,"Forgot to mention that this is an aerospace start up.

I'm generally curious about funding (where it's coming from, how much they have, etc.) though I don't know a tactful way to approach that topic. Outside of financials, my business knowledge is lacking. "
4115,Starting Wendy’s Today,You're better off getting ANY type of paid internship. 
4116,How do i get into the IT field?,"A few paths you can take, some that you have mentioned. Depends on your financial situation but here are some suggestions:

&#x200B;

* Stay at your current job and start taking online courses to obtain specific certifications (depending which sector of IT you want to pursue)
* Take a new job as a entry level help desk and work your way up. Some companies will hire entry level help desk w/o previous IT experience as long as they have customer service experience. 
* Start doing freelancing work to gain experience. 

Essentially if you want to really get a good job in IT, you will need certifications to land a decent job and then advanced certifications/licenses to move up. "
4117,"If I have equity at work, is it okay to ask for a raise closer to market rate?","You can definitely ask for market rate if the company is doing well.  The equity is your compensation for coming in at a risky time and working below market, but that doesn't mean it's a permanent situation. 

However, your equity compensation may be used as a reason to deny the raise.  The dollar value of the equity will (probably) outstrip the disparity in cash compensation. "
4118,Unemployed for 6 months and now for the first time starting as a bank teller! I need your tips!,Get experience at this bank then look at similar jobs at credit unions. You’ll find many with lots of opportunity for growth and that credit unions treat their account holders better.

Well mental issues aren't any different. They are still real medical issues. "
4121,Is it possible to start a job with 80k?,Also depends where you live. In Seattle or the Bay Area fresh grads are cracking well over 6 figures TC doing software. Atlanta 80k does not sound that outlandish for Cybersecurity 
4122,Christmas gift for my manager?,I wouldn’t do a gift. A card sincerely expressing how much you appreciate your manager would be nice. And I wouldn’t give it to them at the party. 
4123,Question about first job ever/first retail job?,Working in retail is the worst. After a while my legs just got used to being up all day. When I used to work at Home Depot I would switch my weight to one leg and just take turns (stand like a 4 but lower the leg so it doesn't look too weird). I have really good balance so that helped a lot.

4125,I’m struggling with employment at the moment,
4126,Pros and cons of a start up vs an established company?,"Do you want to have a life after work?

BIG downside to working at startups is that they work their people to death.   60, 80, 100 hour weeks are common.

You won't get paid extra for that overtime.

&#x200B;

So, unless you are taking a vow of celibacy (no time for relationships if you're working 80 hour weeks) and taking a vow of poverty (startups pay less than market with the promise of equity which may never be worth anything), avoid the startup and take the established company's job. "
4127,Advice for working in an aerospace startup,"What position?

One key with a first job is that very few places will tell you what to do for every minute of the day. So try and ask lots of questions. Take lots of notes. And try and learn new things every day/week/month etc.  

Excel is always important. But the main key is to do the important tasks really well. And know that you don't know what you don't know yet. So take time to learn and stay humble.

4134,Has anyone worked for as a employee for a small local business?,"I got insanely lucky with mine. We build decks all year round unless the ground is frozen. Small company for us means me as the office manager.. two salesman, two or three crew members and the owner. I started out at $11 an hour and each year I’ve been here I’ve got a $1 raise. The more I learn the more I’ll earn. I handle payments, bank runs, material checks, HOAs, permits and inspections and whatever else needs to be done. We build 150+ a year and we do pretty good for ourselves. 

I find that if you find the right small business, and you’re loyal, that loyalty will be rewarded. There are some BS ones out there though so be sure you know your value and don’t let anyone take advantage of that. Before this job I worked the insurance department of a collection agency. I liked the insurance part but i ended up being the person who would do everyone else’s job too because they slacked so then it ended up becoming “part of my job” despite not getting an increase in pay for way more extra shit. 

I am happy where I am, I’m in with the family now and will be working half from home and half from their home soon due to the trust and bonds we built and formed.

* Either way, I would completely evaluate the situation & allow for additional hours that may be expected of you.
* Then I would negotiate a higher figure "
4136,Company asked me to make a template for them but ghosted me right after. Was I scammed?,"You sent on Thursday and followed up Tuesday. 
Do you think you should have given it till the end of the week before panicking ? They could have business commitments, be of sick, be in an accident. 
However, a lot of startups use this tactic frequently because they are run by scumbags who are out of their depth. I agree with some of the other replies. Tell them next time you’d be happy to discuss that if you’re successful with your application. "
4137,How do I ask my boss for the raise I was promised,"First of all, I think its important to know what kind of person your boss is. Is he the mentoring type? Or is he only concerned with assigning responsibilities and nothing else? I think knowing the kind person your boss is will be extremely helpful in starting these kinds of conversations.

For example, if you believe your boss manipulated you to work for less than 12-13 dollars, chances are you're not going to get the raise.

But if you believe your boss is a fair/understanding person, I think its very important to ask him to talk about salary. Every boss I have had that's worth a damn has listened very closely to my concerns about compensation.

When/if you do have the chance to speak to your boss, I think its very important to **NOT** focus on the fact he promised you that amount 3 months ago. Chances are he won't even remember. It can turn into a ""he said, she said"" argument that you won't win. If its not written down in paper, it didn't happen.

 I'm not saying that you should pretend that conversation never happened. Rather, I would shift the focal point to something to this: Explain to your boss why you deserve a raise. Convince him that the quality of work you are outputting warrants that extra pay. 

If you can't think of anything, maybe its time to start to document things you have done in the 3 month span that demonstrates your value to the company.

If he brushes you off or tries to ignore the topic of a raise, then unfortunately you have a tough decision to make. Either stay and make less, or leave for a company that pays you your desired amount.

I wish you the best of luck! "

4141,"Hi. I have a hard time finding a job as a fresh graduate, any tips?","Hello, newly employed Band 5 here, graduated in July. 
First of all, I definitely understand the struggle as I did not find it easy either and like you, I volunteered at several places and I stuggled securing interviews.

Now, there are few things you might be doing wrong. 


1. NHS vs Private
Searching through Indeed tells me you've mainly looked for private jobs, but most clinics want to hire someone with at least 2 years of experience. This might sound like the easier option but I'd suggest mostly focusing on securing and NHS post first to gain some experience and quality 
training.


2. UP THAT SUPPORTING STATEMENT!! 
This is the one element I found made all the difference for me - this is what secures you an interview. A lot of people don't want to feel like bragging and they might overlook things that would sell you to the interviewer because you've assumed they are normal (Such as managing your independent ward etc). They often are not. You did amazingly well on your last placement? Let them know! You had a really niche research done at uni? Let them know why you chose it - it tells them you're passionate about the profession!
Don't be shy in using words like ""outstanding"" and ""excellent"" in relation to the quality of your work. If you don't convince them you're the best possible asset to them, then someone else will. Recruiters will also think ""if they are so insecure about their skills, then why would we be""?
Also, ask a friend to look at it, even if they aren't PT. After my boyfriend (studying 3d animation) helped me tighten my SS , I got asked for 5 interviews of the 7 jobs I applied for.


3. Have patience. 
It's easy to get discouraged after you don't hear back. Persist and work on your application.

Good luck! "

You need to be selling yourself like a professional sales person while also showing a willingness to do work outside your current role.

4150,Tips on how to get a job,"One of the best ways to get hired is to prove that you can follow directions.  Most modern employers take their applications over the internet.  There's nothing wrong with asking, 'Where should I apply for a job?""  They will almost always point you to their internet portal.  Most managers switched to online applications precisely because they don't want to interact with every applicant face-to-face until they are ready for an interview. "

First thing to remember is that you can't save everyone.  Your role (or one of them, I should say) is to be a resource and to *offer* possible solutions as well as an empathetic ear, but you cannot force anyone to take the solutions.  It can be emotionally taxing to see someone who you feel clearly needs to leave a situation return to that situation.  I believe the statistic is that women and men in abusive relationships will try to get out an average of 7 times before they actually stay out.

People who work remotely often put in more hours per day than normal commuting employees.

With anything in business, if has to be justifiable and either save the company money or make the company money. If you can align the idea with that, you will at least have a compelling argument. "

The blessing in disguise is that I was laid off from the position, along with others, and it was such a heavy weight lifted from my shoulders.

A startup can be exciting and have good upside but can also fail just as easy. Are they making money right now? Do they have revenue l? Do they have clients/customers? You will have to research the company and hopefully they are honest with you.  "
4172,How can I start my own business doing osha training?,"First thing:  incorporate.  You could be a LLc or an S Corp.

This is to protect your personal assets in the event you bankrupt.

Next:  errors and omissions as well as other liability insurances.  At least a million dollar policy.

You will need OSHA insurance too.

After that, begin your sales approaches to anybody in your network. You start part time and work yourself into a full time job.

Meaning, when you make more money teaching than you do in your current job, quit and go full time.  

Things to remember:  depending on where you live, you may collect state sales taxes, will need to file federal and state income taxes quarterly, will have to file for permits in your city, county, to work from home until you move out (check your hoa or lease to see if you can do this).  After you get your first check, you’ll need a corporate checking account (bring your papers with you when you do).  And you will need a way to take credit cards.

Lastly, a website with an your name @ websitename . Com email address is much more professional than some gmail email account.  So find a short, easy to remember name and register it.  Pay the $$$ for email capability.

In total, you’ll need about $5k or so to do this.

If you don’t have it, then you scale back.  Regardless, get errors and omissions insurance.   "

4176,Potential Job with a Startup at Series C funding,"You can ask what the last round value was and the per share price, and does that count for this class of shares.
 However there can be shares that are paid first and at higher multiples than the other class of shares. Let's say your 100 million dollar company is eventually sold for 50 million; you could end up with nothing. There's so many examples you should look around the internet for them. 

There's less than 1 in 10 that it's a huge exit, so not sure that the range you gave accounts for all the flame outs but that might be a handy rule of thumb for how much less salary you get?  I.e. not that much less, but I'm far removed from startup land. Don't forget you are probably working more hours.

They can also dilute the shares in future rounds or have a down round.  "

4179,Leaving the corporate rat race behind: who has left the job market to start a business and succeeded?,"I didn't quite take the full risk of starting my own business, but I did leave a secure, decent-paying job at a large corporation to work alongside an old business mentor to get a new division at a small business off the ground.  So, we didn't have to deal with the typical admin/legal/accounting side of the equation (my mentor precisely took this opportunity to escape those challenges in running his own ""one-man"" consulting firm), yet we were placed into a sink-or-swim situation with regard to getting the department off the ground; either we became revenue neutral by year end or we probably weren't going to remain a part of the company.

The biggest thing we had walking into that situation was we already had clients lined up to avail themselves of our services so we could begin bringing in money as we developed more business in the meantime.  Similar to starting your own business, we learned quickly that starting our own department meant that we only had ourselves to do the work.  We couldn't afford staff to do the dirty stuff, so if a client needed us on-site tomorrow to dig holes and measure stuff, we were on a plane ourselves to do it.  We didn't have templates for reports, manuals for standard procedures, or software created to meet our needs, so we had to create, develop, and buy every bit of it.  We probably worked 80-100 hours a week in those first few months getting the foundation laid for our department.  We're at Year Two now and only now have things started to settle down as we have managed to find, train, and maintain staff to perform some of our operations for us.  However, there are still plenty of times where my boss or I have to do things personally because of the particular niche in which we work; we don't get the luxury of being too tired for anything because if we don't do it, then it doesn't get done and no one gets paid.

I can only say that my boss and I are workaholics and do get quite a bit of satisfaction from the particular work we do.  It's not for everyone, and I will provide a word of caution that when you own a small business, you still have a boss to whom to answer.  It's just that your boss goes from a single manager or CEO to the client, and clients aren't always the fairest bosses.  Providing a service or product to paying customers often means compromising your own vision or view of how a particular service should be rendered or product should be developed in service of getting those customers to buy it.  You may think yellow wallpaper is ugly, but if your customers want it, then you are stuck choosing between your personal taste and your desire to put food on the table for yourself.  That's not to say you have to completely sell out, but the distinction between a job and a hobby lies precisely in the degree to which you are willing to adapt your individual perspective to meet the needs of consumers who may have a different perspective.

I should also mention I work night shift. I find keeping everything clean and wiped down as well as  keeping your things stocked will help you close faster.  There will be times when that just doesn't happen and you  just have to accept it. When I first started it took me a little  over a month to finally learn most things and get faster, you just have to breathe and ask for help. I've almost had a panic attack before I got better, just give it over a month, I notice most new people will quit after one month. "

\- You could run training sessions for people who are new to computers.

\- Show them how to use app stores etc.

I personally don't think you'll make much money. But it'll be interview gold when you are looking for a real job / applying to courses. If it was me, I'd do it for free (or tips) and offer a more advanced session if they want it. That way you get lots of experience rather than trying to charge money and no one wanting to pay.

Start small and keep your job - or maybe find an accounting job that is part-time/flexible. Remember, depending on where you are operating the business, paving can only be completed in a specific temperature range. So, months that are too cold = no paycheck. 

Also, maybe look out for a small paving company with the proper equipment and trained employees that you can buy. Seek one that you can add value too, like advertising, better financing, and by seeking higher margin jobs.

What's the market rate for your position, for someone with your education and experience?  Has the cost of living gone up?  Take those into account when negotiating a raise.  Remember that compensation isn't everything.  You can negotiate a flexible schedule, PTO, attending conferences, tuition assistance, etc. "

4227,"Recruiter called about role @ ""stealth mode"" startup??","My experience is that stealth mode is a bad indicator unless they are really breaking some high-tech new ground or have a government contract. 

Otherwise, stealth-mode companies tend to struggle because they aren't learning enough, quickly enough, from their customers and the industry surrounding them. Often this means burning through investment only to find out the product isn't what the market wants or that the UX isn't as good as it should be.

The kind of company that families could find security in, not cut corners and abuse legal loopholes to increase the pay to us (the first 4 employees+) It's good to figure out your own moral compass and do some sniffing around with some drinks early on.

It's your option to disclose this, but many have this so that they can know if you need an accommodation and provide this for you.  I can't recall if this is only done post-hire (many companies will have a section about needing accommodations for interviews too), but do some research on what companies allow for this. They cannot base their opinion of you off the disclosure of this information - it's simply to state you might need a different environment, setup, etc. "

The fact is, good training and management is an exception, not the rule in business. Learning how to work with that scenario instead of fighting against it will lead to a happier and more successful you. 

The first thing you should do in a new job is skill up fast. If your spreadsheet skills are rusty, watch some YouTube videos. If you’re struggling to keep up, find tools or techniques to be more efficient with your day. Pay attention to your teammates to see what really needs to be prioritized and what can be dealt with later.

Don't worry about it being some huge new feature, it could just be fixing a few bugs or a couple minor new features, even enhancing existing features.

Anyone can read a book on Python and list it on a CV, so showing that you can actually apply that knowledge in a practical way will help set you apart. One of the hardest things about being a programmer is trying to understand someone else's code, so showing that you can do that enough to make some minor improvements will definitely work in your favor with any hiring manager that also writes code.

4269,I feel like I’m being rabbitholed into a role with no signs of opportunity.,"i've dealt with this before and it sucks. it usually means that you're too valuable in the position that you're in so rather than rocking the boat by moving you up the ladder and attempting to fill in an empty hole, you're left where you are because you're consistent. you should try to ask for a raise and have evidence to support what you want. if you do this, you should also be prepared for them to refuse to give you a raise. at that point you should just look for a better job. "
4270,I've been out of work for five years. I'm looking for a job training program with job placement.,"You likely want an apprenticeship somewhere in the trades. No college needed, on the job training where you'll work up to a full wage in a field with where you're placed/hired. You may have to take placement tests and may have some coursework, but it's more akin to community college work than the undergrad level. 

Alternately, most trades that don't need apprenticeships will hire pretty quickly if you show initiative you will work hard and not complain (ie landscaping, house painting, etc). Temp agencies place relatively quickly if one isn't too picky and may know of decent companies to work that I obviously can't think of since I'm not local to your area.

If there's no training or temp labor locally, take whatever you can find, and grind until you have enough money saved to move or be able to at least commute to a larger town/city. 

If you're looking for tech such as software dev/web design/UX/etc, well, there are some bootcamp programs that offer guarantees for job placement if you finish the courses and offer deferred tuition- but they often come with catches similar to student loans where you'll be paying back the tuition deferred at a yearly % of your income once you are placed in the job the school helped you get. "

They just give you 1% informations and expect you to know everything. "
4272,How relevant are CompTIA Certifications in today's business world?,"Yes, these are still relevant and they do help you stand out compared to other applications who don't have them.  I would definitely hire someone with 2 years non-it work experience and one or two comptia certs over a guy with 0, 1, or 2 years of entry level IT work and no certification.  Plus, it's WAY cheaper than a degree and these certifications do require you to do some continuing education where degrees do not.  Given the low cost, you really can't lose.  If you already know a lot of the material, check out professor messer on youtube - he offers a free video course, but it's fast paced and he's always saying ""buy the $35 notes"".  If you don't know the content well, go to your local community college's continuing education department (not the for credit or seeking degree courses) and get the hands-on experience taking things apart and putting them back together or cutting and terminating ethernet cables, etc.

4275,applying to ralphs (grocery store),"I used to work as a cashier in a grocery store. Not sure what your post will be, but if you work as a cashier then basically you just stand there and cash people out. Someone will train you on your first day, and maybe the next few days. I had 3 training days where someone would stand by my side and tell me what to do. Don't stress out, cuz whoever gonna train you know that you are new and will be easy on you. Even the customers will be easy on you, just use the newbie card. Under normal circumstances, you will need to make small talks, but now better dont talk at all :))

Don't worry too much, there is no use worrying about it now. Go for interview/first shift and see how it goes! Good luck! "
4276,Should I be worried? Should I bring this up with my TL or boss?,Hey thats excellent news! First of all i can tell you from experience that when you train into a job while its hitting the fan you generally will always perform better than people trained in during slow easy times. Id also imagine youre a bit less stressed now. Keep pushing on it and youll go far. You got this! 
4277,Are there any jobs that train and pay you?,"If you were to work for the railroad or on the inland towboat/barge industry you could get paid training to be an engineer after a few years lol.

But I highly doubt there is any engineer jobs that have paid training outside of the military. In terms of technology jobs in general, there isn't really any significant paid training outside of your training when you first get the job. They're usually only hiring people people who have some skill in their field whether through a degree or certificates. 

If you're interested in non tech related fields, there's paid training in a lot of job fields that don't have a ton of movement upwards but are generally hurting for workers, usually labor intensive. The major trade jobs such as electrician, plumber, sheet metal, pipe fitter, etc, usually have apprenticeship programs you have to apply for. HVAC apprenticeships are usually just low level labor positions with HVAC companies, but they'll definitely train you. Any sort of job that has the title ""field service technician"" usually has extensive paid training. 

The best option is engineering school. If you're smart enough to do it, it's pretty hard to be unemployed. Even if you can't find that sexy 60k entry level engineering job, whatever your field is, electrical, computer, mechanical, etc, there are companies that will hire you to do something. If you don't think you're smart enough to do engineering school, trade school is the best option. A lot of trades are in need of workers as over the last 10+ years people went to get professional degrees. But not only that, you can go to trade school for a 'non-trade' Such as IT, accounting, or something in the medical field. Trade schools are also usually pretty good at getting students lined up with jobs before they even graduate. "

As long as you’re not working an medical emergency line it’s completely ok to tell anyone on the phone “I am new here but I am going to take care of your issue completely. Please bear with me as I fumble thru this new system (uncomfortable laugh) but just know that I’m here for you and we will resolve this together. I also really thank you for your patience with me and for giving me the opportunity to get better by working with you”. 

They are either going to be like “oh hell no” or (most likely) say “I’ve been there, no troubles bubbles” (sorry, I watched Wayne’s world 2 recently). 

As for as management, tell them the same thing you said to us. “I want to do a good job, but being new I kinda blank when put on the spot. I’m taking steps to fix this outside of work, and the more experienced I get that will of course fade away”. 

They won’t be getting customer complaints and they will be understanding to you needing time bc they were there themselves. You sound like a determined and great employee and they will see through the newbie jitters. You’ll be fine!! "

Also, do not get into programming, or any other aspect of IT, just because it's got the promise of money. I've watched people crash in tech over and over when they just got into it because they thought it was the safe financial choice. "

Also, if your city is big enough, you might have a career center or nonprofit that focuses on workforce development and may offer classes to develop soft skills.

CNC can be intimidating to let someone without experience run because when things go bad they go really bad really quick.

At my last job I didn't ask questions because I understood what to do and honestly didn't have any, but my supervisor told me she wished I asked more questions to show that I truly understood what she wanted from me. It's stupid. People don't simply want you to do your job and do your job well, they want you to do things their way. Everyone likes to criticize and cannot recognize what you did right.

When I do something the manager tells me to do , the receptionist who’s training me is saying that I’m doing it wrong and corrects me, it’s a constant back and fourth.

4296,What REAL jobs can you do from computer?,"We’re moving towards a world where cloud infrastructure is the norm due to change in cost structures for business.

4318,Training Course Dilemma,"I'd just say that I thought I had the bandwidth and time to do the course, but in thinking more carefully about it, now isn't going to be a good time for it.  With that said, you can't really avoid the impression that you don't really see yourself being there in the long-term as most managers understand the implication here, so if your plan really is to be gone in at most 3 months, then I'd get moving on that plan.

So many agencies do prefer their counselors to be in recovery.

Also, most of the therapists in the SUD field are MSW - Masters of Social Work.

If they gave machining classes just go through their catalogue and see what entry level classes are available, and go from there. 


As an example look at DeAnza college in Cupertino. They have 2 year degrees for machining, programming, CAD,etc and help students get jobs and internships while they study and after.

For PLUs, make a cheat sheet with receipt paper and put it at eye level with tape if possible. If that isn't possible, you can sit it at another empty spot on your register. When I was being trained, I was told to write the most commonly purchase PLUs (apples, bananas, potatoes, mixed nuts, self serve candy, etc, etc). It's a lot easier to look at a cheat sheet of 20 for a PLU than thumbing through five pages that has a horrible naming system (i.e. green beans being under B for beans green, but kidney beans being under K).

&#x200B;

The expectation for you to be fast on your first day is ridiculous. If a cashier is fast on their first day with no previous experience, they're doing something wrong. Believe it or not, it's a skill and like any skill, you get better with practice and you lose it when you don't use it. Also you are not a burden to your coworkers. Even with my slowest coworkers, at the end of the day, I'm just happy I got some help.

&#x200B;

For your health, shoes, a weight belt, and the most important move. Whenever possible, walk around your register. Also if you need to sit down go to the bathroom. At my old store there was a small seating area for breastfeeding slightly separated from the bathroom. On days when the pain was unbearable I would go sit there once the store died down for about 3-5 minutes.

As for working in a toxic work environment, leave as soon as you can. If you can't then talk to your coworkers and build a friendly relationship with those who are trustworthy. Stay away from gossiping and be friendly to all your coworkers, even the toxic ones. Remember, this is not your permanent job. It will get better. "

4353,Is an edX course certificate worth buying?,"edX certificates range in price from around $50-$100. So if you are just paying for the certificate I would say definitely not worth the price.

Like other said prospective employers and anyone else will believe you when you say you have done the course and you can show a screenshot of the congratulations page when you finish the course if you need proof.

I do think that in some cases paying for the certificate is worth it and that is because it also unlocks *more features* in the course.

Some skills are hard to learn. When you pay for a certificate you also get access to more of the exams and you will have your assignments graded.

This **feedback** is often invaluable to see if you are making progress or just following the videos.

Another good way to decide if you want to invest the money is to think of how much *your time is worth*.

Think of the money as an **investment** against your time, it will help you stay motivated through the harder parts of the learning curve.

* If the course is 48 hours over 12 weeks then $75 might be a good idea
* If you just want a quickie course then take the free option

Here is a longer break down of the edX [online certificates](https://www.theschoolbell.net/online-courses-with-certificates) if you are interested.

If you aren’t sure about the certificate start with the free option then upgrade if you love the course or want some more feedback. "

My advice would be to set your rate pretty low to start with and make sure you nail the first jobs and get a good review as clients often look at your success score and if you can get top rated status you will get lots of people contacting you with opportunities. Once you’ve built up some good reviews you can increase your rate as you see fit. Also it is worth trying to build relationships and get done long term clients if you are looking to get steady work.

4. Is your career center not actively helping you find a coop? Other than providing resume reviews?
5. The art of interviewing is just sounding confident and practicing. You can do this in normal discourse, spend a little bit of time to think before you speak and make sure you articulate well - even on a colloquial basis, this will go far.
6. honestly, see if you can get any presentation opportunities in classes. this will help your interview prep.
7. If your school expects you to find your own co-op how have you been networking with your peers. Can you get a mentor in this co-op program and get help that way? 
8. Network with other students and see if they can get you into a co-op. "

That mountain of dishes is this job that you just got.

But...how do you do this? There's a fuck tone of 'em!

You put them into piles.

Stack the plates over there and start gathering the bowls. Put the silverware in the sink to soak. Let's toss the pots and pans waaaaay over there... we'll do that last. Find a spot for all the cups and then evaluate.

Everything is still a mess...but it's an organized mess. Identify which one you want to do first and then do one pile at a time.

Those piles are the tasks you've identified that need doing. The silverware was tasks that aren't time sensitive and the pots and pans are big items that can be done later.

Pretty soon, all the dishes are done and you've got a clean kitchen (job).

Hope that helps!! "

Just for comparison, I topped out at one company being paid $27.00 an hour, plus health benefits, vacation and sick time, and I was paid for two hours per day extra during my on-call rotation.

It's a great high-school early college job. Relaxed atmosphere, fun staff and as a movie lover, the benefits were great. Made a lot of great friends and they were flexible around my schedule. Cons are obviously lowish pay, it's a desirable job so they don't give a ton of raises. I was a decent employee so I ended up with around 10 bucks an hr but most people start and stay at around 8. Also retail. I didn't have too many bad customer experiences but there are definitely plenty of turds out there. 

Think it mostly depends on your situation in life though. I wouldn't look at it as a job you can develop, merely one you can hold onto for a while until something better comes along.

So you're not saying ""I don't know what to do"" but instead you're prioritising whats most important and then building on it. Then I'd try and agree a timetable where you can say ""I'd like to be comfortable with this software/process and be able to work on these type of tasks by August, then while I'm working on those I can learn this next thing by October."" If it's agreed by both of you then it gives you peace of mind that you're hitting your targets and your boss peace of mind that you're progressing as expected. "

I started my new job 2 months ago, also highly recommended by another company. They gave me some login codes, a car and a client list: and of I went.

Two months is, I'm trying really hard but when figuring it all out by myself, I might not write as many orders as they hoped. Though at least I brought in some new prospects. However, I heard no feedback so I thought I was doing alright and they would just cut me some slack.

Until last weekend, when i ""accidentally"" used the company credit card because I lost mine (did inform hr immediately!) for personal use, then got an email from hr saying this COULD be reason for determination but then I called her crying and we were alright. I felt like crap for the rest of the week, and in order to prove my thrustwortyness, sending all kinds of emails regarding my whereabouts, thus causing only more miscommunication. Then my manager send me a really pissed off email, saying I was making my own position hardly bearable and had to shut my mouth and SELL. So I freaked out.

4388,Tips for making an employee training program?,"We're doing this exact thing at my work right now.

Basically, we built a front end in excel that is coloured up in company colours, and all the buttons on the GUI are hyperlinked to locations in a file directory. Within each linked file are 3-4 resources. 

1. the training module (i.e. excel sheet with data, explanation on what methodology is used to process that data, and calculation checks)

2. a tutorial video (I used OBS studio - it's free and seems to work well)

3. a notepad file that you add your initials to to check off that you've done it and also checked for errors (essentially acting as like a wiki of sorts)

4. any other relevant content

So, we've built this index, and now we're filling it up with content.

We're also going to record presentations from industry leaders and stuff like that to help pass on knowledge from company and industry veterans.

The idea is we're trying to make records of stuff that is known, and knowledge that has taken years to accumulate, then put it in an easily accessible structure, complete with full walkthroughs on how to actually *do* it.

So, we have, for example, field studies, tests, which generate data, so our breakdown (so far) is something like this:

* geotechnical -> subdirectory: analytics/field work/calculations
  


*geochemical -> lab testing/static/kinetic/field testing

*hydrogeology -> field tests/data handling/GW modelling

Etc. so each sub-directory has a new list, and you just keep drilling down until you find what you're looking for.

Hope that helps - eventually we'll replace the excel/VBA GUI with an actual app. "

What may seem like aggression towards you could be a reaction to the change of having you there and not you personally. Just try your best and don’t complain, and you should be fine. The goal is to blend in as much possible so they forget about you and don’t target you for abuse.

4434,Why exactly are new hires made to learn so fast for?,"It comes down to the cost of hiring someone. An employee is an added cost to the business. Not just in terms of salary, but there payroll taxes, overhead expenses, training expenses (time spent training you is time that someone else has to pull away from their main job). A business wants to recover that cost quickly. Naturally larger organizations can take the hit early, but imagine a small business of 10. 

I know many small business owners, and many of them tell me that the most terrifying thing that they ever had to do was hire their first employee because what if they hired the wrong person? Many of them are nervous about employee hires in general because on the business end it is a huge investment of resources and time.

4454,How to handle 1st round HR salary expectation rush?,">and almost always HRs ask me for salary expectation which I try to evade, but then HRs push me with annoyance sensible from the other side of the phone.

It's not tactics. They are trying to see if you are affordable. They want to NOT insult you with a low offer. HR doesn't give a crap what you make. Their job is to make sure the hiring manager offers something reasonable. 

If you want $170,000 and the job pays $80,000? They're going to look for other positions and opportunities for you.

I have TWICE this week gone to bat for people who made less than I thought they should in their current position and both have offers out for at least 20% raises from where they are (both not internal candidates.... they were both shocked... but I looked at what the market pays them and got them to a reasonable level for their skill set) One of them is getting an offer $30K OVER what the hiring manager wanted to offer.

Why? Because the Hiring manager has no idea how much this person SHOULD make and neither does the person who applied - who is grossly underpaid at their current position. (I thought she was going to cry when I told her the offer today)

Y'all think HR is the enemy. It's not an ""us VS them"" game. We are both pulling on the same side of the rope. You want a job. I want to give you a job. The hiring manager is the PITA who is in the way.

4459,How I broke out of retail & got a 6 figure salary in 3 years,"The problem with a post like this is that you are setting someone up to get caught, denied a job or at the worst, fired after they got the job from lying. People fib on their resume and embellish all of the time, but every now and then you will be asked of your proficiency with skills you listed. I interviewed at a sports media company last year over the phone and the interviewer wanted to bring me in to test my CSS skills as I had listed it on my resume. Did I use CSS in my everyday? Yes, but not to the extent they wanted me to do so. Luckily I didn't have to do any hand coding, just observation and telling him what I saw. It didn't cost me the job as HR ultimately canceled the position, but I came away with a very important lesson.

You've somehow managed to skate by without getting tripped up and good for you, but your situation isn't a one size fits all. The advice you listed can be found on any Business Insider/Forbes careers related article and it isn't necessarily good advice especially #5. If anyone is just starting their career post-college, DO NOT follow what he said. That's how you develop bad habits and develop a piss poor reputation around the office especially among those who you're screwing over when you decide to show up late/leave early. I've worked with people like you so that's why it bothers me that you're advising others to follow your lead.

4484,Do you wished you had done some job shadowing before declaring your major in college?,"Major: Fine Arts; Graphic Design & Illustration

Current occupation: Medical Lab Assistant

Satisfaction: 6/10

I don't have an actual degree, more a collection of certificates and diplomas, but altogether it was a year of fine arts and three years of graphic design and illustration.

I don't know if job shadowing would have helped in my case, because graphic design (and other illustration/fine art related jobs) SEEM fun and cool, but no one really warns you about the downsides when you're a student -- little job security, tough competition, work being outsourced. There's also the fact that if you don't work for a design firm or in-house as a company graphic designer, then you pretty much have to freelance, and guess what, there's even less job security there. And, to succeed you have to be just as good at business, networking, and all that jazz as you are at the actual art/design.

It's not like we didn't visit countless design firms in my program (we did, and even went to NY to visit ad agencies and typography foundaries and the society of illustrators)... but somehow I guess I never realized that my personality and natural skillset did not fit these fields at all.

I almost screwed myself over trying to change careers, too... I jumped into a medical lab assistant program without really realizing that it would be 90% phlebotomy. Job shadowing really would have helped me there!! It's not the needles and blood that bothers me, it's the constant interaction with patients, a lot of whom are grumpy because they're fasting, or because they're sick, or scared of needles, or tired of waiting an hour for blood work... and so on. I'm an introvert and I tend to take on other people's emotions and it was extremely difficult to have so many different interactions with the public in one day.

Thankfully, my workplace has opportunities for lab assistants to work behind the scenes at the testing lab, receiving/sorting specimens and helping to set up cultures for the lab techs, and that's what I do now. No more interacting with the public. I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't been able to make that switch. I was seriously a basket case working as a phlebotomist, and I dreaded every day -- yet I couldn't change careers yet again because I'd exhausted all my sources of support. I'm so thankful I was able to make a lateral move like that.

Anyway.... I guess what I'm trying to say is that job shadowing can be useful at times but not in all situations! It really depends what kind of a headspace you're in, too. When I was younger I was much more willing to delude myself and gloss over troubling things about my proposed career. I was wearing rose-coloured glasses. "

When you are young that is the time to do the 60-80 hour weeks while you grow your resume.  When you are older, get the pay and lifestyle adjustment that you need.  There is some wisdom in being older and having a team of direct reports under you, so you don't necessarily have to do all the heavy lifting but can take ownership of products, steer the company, plant your vision, etc.  Anyway the sky is the limit but, no, you are seeing this very very small sliver of actual careers.

4489,Anyone study their ass off in university just to end up in a job you don’t like?,"Yes, that is exactly what happened to me. And then fired from said job I hated. Stripping me of the little shreds of dignity I actually had left.

Oh but there's more. Much more. Not going into details on here, especially since I post on this subreddit with my other account. I wouldn't want people to identify who I am and know these sordid embarrassing details. But in my case, I not only ended up in a job I was overqualified for that I detest it, but it took years just to find that. Right after college, I struggled and was stuck working in retail. I ended up literally homeless because my parents reached a point where they said I was not able to stay at home anymore, and I didn't have enough money or credit to have my own place. Eventually when I got back on my feet, it was only because I worked 72 80-hour weeks in menial jobs such as at a restaurant and a warehouse. Just being able to climb from the Dirt 2 lower working class was a huge amount of hard work as it was. What's really pathetic is, my most recent job felt like a godsend to me, even though it was a job I was overqualified for that only required an associate's degree when I already had a bachelor's degree. After I started there, the job got worse. I got transferred to different times within five years. My job has multiple branch locations, so it's easy to short people around. Also, they stopped giving out any raises whatsoever as part of a salary freeze due to the government budget cuts. So for more than half the time I worked there, I received no raise in sight. The people that worked with seemed really cool and friendly when I first started, but over the years the people I worked with didn't seem so friendly. They seemed Katty and clicky. It reminded me of high school a little to be honest. That might also be because getting shifted around had me feeling like new girl complex at each different location, and the most recent location had a lot of older women who we're rather snooty towards me. "
4490,Anyone else struggling with motivation during lockdown?,You're not alone - I'm resigning though to take a break anyways. 
4491,Anyone feel like life isn’t the way they imagined it would turn out?,"I’m overwhelmed by all the responses. I feel grateful for what everyone has said. I live in such a bubble that I always think I am the only one going through these things in life, so it’s comforting to know I am not alone. I am still trying to figure out what I want to do and I know it is a journey. I will get there eventually. "
4492,I found my coworkers have a secret group chat where they slander my name or chat about me. What should I do?,"To be honest with you, I would talk to them about it. Unless they’re all completely cold and awful people, they will probably apologize and try to have a legitimate conversation about it. I would be looking for another job too, but having an open, adult conversation about this would be for the best imo, no matter the consequences. "
4493,Does anyone else feel like people in corporate like to make things a lot more difficult than they need to be?,"I think a lot of it is just people CYA. Not sure there is much you can do. If you do find something, please share it with me. "
4494,How do I tolerate a 9-5?,"Jesus, well you need to change your attitude first, we’re all (not all but you know) in the same boat. Try to stay jolly and focus on outside of work. "
4495,How do I get over my deep-seated dislike of working?,"There are certainly a lot worse things you could do.  It seems to me that past generations worked hard to build an infrastructure so that you can work at a comfortable desk job rather than doing manual labor such as hunting and foraging for food, etc..  If you want to earn a living and provide for yourself, this is how it works.  I think you just need to find something you enjoy doing. "
4496,"It’s no longer enough to do your job, but you have to be above and beyond to keep it?","I'm a manager in a global company. 

Yes I would say to expect this in a lot of places. Once someone meets expectations, the goalposts move. 

An employees ability to do their job makes them a competent employee.  A competent employee is someone who can be and often is let go for underperformance.

We have a recognition portal that we are required to use every month (gives out points that can be turned into gift cards).  If someone doesn't get recognized for their contributions to the business in one way or another, they are seen as ""not part of the team"" or ""not invested in the company's success"". 

Its not a live to work thing, we have excellent standards for work/life balance.  But its more of a work to constantly exceed expectations. Average is not good enough because it means someone doesn't care enough to continuously improve. "
4497,Do you feel like COVID-19 is going to change the workforce permanently?,I could care less about corona I feel its overhyped while I do acknowledge it's a real issue and some common sense precautions would make sense. I dont think this will forever change society 
4498,Is it worth leaving a job for the sake of your mental health?,"It’s all about how much you care. 
I was in the exact same position as you few months back until I realised.. why do I care so much? I’m just there for a pay check. Now if I do something wrong, I ask for feedback. Do things exactly how my manager likes them. I don’t complain, always say yes. And never ever think about him during my day. It’s simple but so freaking effective! 
If anything, I now have started liking the way he works and feel I’m learning so much more. I also have an anxiety disorder and can say that you should really only take medication if that is the last straw. If nothing else helps. 
Just say f*ck it and focus on something that actually matters for yourself and your life. A random manager at X point in your life is rarely that!

Of course, if you can find something better, then definitely leave the job. "
4499,does anyone regret the college degree that they got?,If it's not STEM it's worthless. 
4500,I was rejected from a position that required a high school diploma when I have a bachelor's. How am I supposed to properly handle how pathetic I feel right now?,Probably because you’re not a good looking white male. It’s an unfair world. 
4501,My company keeps forcing everyone to do social activities on webcam as a means of overcompensating for the fact that we're working from home. I'm really not a fan of this. What should I do?,One of my clients is letting people choose whether or not to come in. Most people are coming in. Those that are staying home arent doing much work morale is bad and others are having to do more to get them work. I think forced anything is good right now to keep people engaged 
4502,"What are some niche careers that while not that widely known, you think people should be aware of?","Sales Engineer - A mix between an engineer and a business position.

Pay is average 100k nationwide. Sales Engineering managers can make 250-500k. 

You just need a B.S in engineering and some decent social skills. "
4503,What is it about the 9-5 corporate life that seems to suck my soul away despite having worked much harder in university?,This is not a question. This sub is not really meant for rants but this is becoming too common. 
4504,"Hello Millenials. I'm graduating university next year into the recession/depression, and I'm terrified. How did you survive the 2009 recession and its aftermath?",I was in 9th grade 
4505,How is it true that full-time office job is the ultimate goal of all these years of studying?,"Im in the same boat, but I should also be more grateful for what I have. I wasn't in nearly as bad of environments as some if the other redditors here but I worked in a hellscape of a kitchen environment, run by skeleton crews only and a manager that made Gordon Ramsey look nice for 10 an hr because it was state mandated. He threw a fit he had to pay us more.

The office life gets crap because it is the status quo, but I make more money than all of my friends, have time after work and weekends, I get great PTO, great bennies, and my job is very low stress. The worse thing? I get bored. That's what drive s me insane. While I can do more and do better, it made me realize my biggest problem is being bored. First world problems my god, I really feel spoiled now.

My advice to you would be this:
We have the goals and aspirations, these are unfounded for the most part (we dont really know what the other side will be like until we are there). We can do our best to predict  and we might even get in our own heads to create a reality that isn't there or doesn't need to be but it's our responsibility to understand this and do what we can to really understand our situation and circumstances. You have the advantaged of leverage, use this and develop hobbies and or more education to go farther and do more.

We are often told school > job > retirement but it is SOO much more complex than that. School is only a couple years of your life, you still have so many more years ahead. The only way to find fulfillment is to keep moving forward and I absolutely hate that that's true but it is. Nobody is going to be happy being stagnated.

Keep going, you have it good compared to the majority of the world, use this to propel yourself beyond your current state and be EVEN better. This sounds a bit cheesy, but this is also coming from a cynic who used to contemplate suicide on a daily basis because I realized what you did but I didn't understand the purpose behind all of it which most people seldom tell you about - let alone know.

4509,"Is adult life after college just sort of, guesswork and taking it one day at a time?","It is.

Would you choose the job or make sure your relative is as safe as possible and quit?",Ask your employer to lay you off so you can collect unemployment. 
4511,"I dropped the ""F"" word in a meeting a few months ago.. I apologized already but my coworker is still being passive aggressive about it towards me... How can I fix this?",You didn't just curse... you were directing anger at people and swore as a result. That's aggressive. 
4512,"Serious question, why do many entry level jobs require 2-3 years of experience?","Because 0 experience means that they can’t justify absolutely no experience. They want to know you have an idea what the industry is about.

Also it’s an ideal. Not the end of the line minimum. As they say, if you are ready for the job you waited too long. If you had 3 years experience you’d be the manager of that position. 

Last it’s not uncommon (in fact it’s expected) for business and STEM students to have 2-3 internships or lab work under their belt by graduation. If you haven’t done one yet you are far behind your peers. "

Then you can ask them, why you no doctor yet!? "
4514,Why do employers and candidates play these little charades during the interview/hiring process?,The entire thing is used to add useless work. A lot of companies like having useless jobs for HR 
4515,Is it normal to just not know what you want to do?,no its not. you are just a lazy scumbag 
4516,Do you regularly wish you had a new job?,"I have never had a job I didn't think to myself 'ok I just need to stick to this for - long then I've got enough experience and I can move on'. 
I just always want to try and learn new things. Im currently saving to quit and go back to school at the end of the year. "
4517,How do you stop constant job rejections effecting your mental health?,"For me, it's virtually impossible.  There's only so many job rejections that I can tolerate, you know?  I am really the very worst prospective employee that you want to reject, seriously.  I have a set limit as to how many job rejections I can literally tolerate in a row.  Let's say the number is 15 sequential job rejections....

So with each job rejection I get, I always ask WHY I was rejected.  Now some people say that I'm not entitled to an answer, but I sorely beg to differ.  I was the one who took the time to get my resume ready for YOU, and I took the time to fill out your lengthy-ass application.  Therefore, you at least OWE me a detailed one or two-sentence explanation as to why you rejected me, and the explanation CANNOT be something like, ""We hired a candidate with better qualifications.""  Well, WHAT qualifications does that person have that make him/her better than me?  I want to know so that I can actually GET those qualifications if I don't have them, know what I mean?  I also require an answer for a rejection because if I'm making a mistake, I will know NOT to make the same mistake for future applications I send out, and thus won't be wasting my damn time.  Following me so far?  Ok, good...the fun has yet to begin...

This is my standard operating procedure (SOP) for dealing with a job rejection.  Now in the early rejection phase (say, for the first 5 rejections in a row), I only email them back once asking why I was rejected.  Then when we get to the 6th through 10th rejection, I start getting more insistent...maybe 3 emails or so for each rejection.  THEN, when we get to the 11th through 15th sequential rejection, the anger starts building up to a grand crescendo, to the point of harassment actually.  I call them up, I leave voicemails, I send up to 10 emails asking for a legitimate explanation as to why exactly I was refused employment for the 13th time.

For the lucky 15th prospective employer who rejects me, that's the lucky winner!  They get a death threat, folks!  Yes!  A death threat!  (As you can tell, I am quite psychopathic, having experienced serious career trauma over the past 15 years...\*hint\* that's where my 15th job rejection limit comes from!)  Lord, when is that universal basic income going to become a reality so that at least your food and rent are covered at the bare minimum???  This would alleviate SO much anguish and potential death...seriously!!!!  To me, these job rejections are direct denials of my right to earn a living so that I can actually survive and thrive, so if you deny ME that, I'll sure as hell make sure that you don't have that right either.  What's FAIR IS FAIR. "

How to Find and Develop Your Passion in Life

How do people find their passion? That thing that makes them get out of bed every morning
excited to face the day? Did they always know what it was or did they learn later in life?

First of all, your passion is not necessarily going to be what you do for a living. You can be
great at your job even if it’s not what your passionate about. So let’s divide this exercise into
two parts: FINDING YOUR PASSION and FINDING A JOB YOU ARE OK WITH AND THAT
ENABLES YOU TO PURSUE YOUR PASSION. 

Take a Deep Breath
Before we begin we have to be aware that you’re going to feel some discomfort at some point during the exercise. Fear, insecurities, impostor syndrome, what ifs. That’s all normal because change is hard, you’ve probably been in your comfort zone of misery at your job or in your present lifestyle for a while and it’s hard to push yourself out of that comfort zone. For now, just ignore the discomfort. Later we’ll deal with your limits, how far you’re willing to venture out of the zone.

Next, turn off your NEGATIVE SELF-TALK. It’s going to want to say things like, “I could learn how to dance. I’ve always wanted to do that. But there’s no way I can become a dancer at my age!” or “I’ve always wanted to learn how to fly a plane. But it must be so hard. I don’t
think I have the time. Plus it must be expensive.” Finding your passion is about taking action
not about listening to that negative little voice in your head that keeps you paralized with fear and doubt. It’s not about practicalities right now. It’s about finding out what your passion is and whether your passion is going to be a part of your job or something you do outside of your work.

Steps to Your Passion
Get a notebook and let's get started!

What would you be willing to do without getting paid?
What can you do for hours without getting bored?
How would you spend your time if money weren’t a problem?
What do you love to talk about when you’re with friends?
Who are you jealous of because of the job they have?
Look back at your life and identify moments when you felt great.  What were you doing? What elements combined to make those moments great?

Have you considered that your passion may be something you haven’t tried yet?  If you’ve lived in your comfort zone for a long time, chances are you haven’t tried new things much. What things have you always wanted to try but haven’t yet?  Painting? Learning a language? Writing a book?

What things have you done that you’re proud of?

Close your eyes and imagine yourself 5 years in the future. What are you doing? What lifestyle are you living?

Time to Do Some Cooking
Now, start combining hard skills, soft skills and the traits mentioned by the people who know you best.

Let’s imagine these are all ingredients and if we combine some of them, we can
bake a cake, if we combine others, we can prepare a salad.  They’re not the same food, but they’re both delicious.  For example, I speak 3 languages + I’m diplomatic + I love to travel = I can be a foreign language teacher abroad. On the other hand, I’m organized + I’m a good writer + I love reading = I can become a freelance editor or copywriter.

As you can see, those are two very different jobs, yet we arrived at both of them combining my different skills.

Steps to Finding the Job You’re OK with
As mentioned before, it may turn out that your passion is not your job and that's fine. That's true for most of us. But it's important to find work that doesn't make you miserable. So let's go back to the notebook!

List the jobs you definitely do not want to do or would even consider.

Make a list of your HARD skills. These are measurable abilities, school learned abilities such as writing, reading, math, using computer software.

Make a list of your SOFT skills. Traits such as etiquette, diplomacy, communication, listening, getting along with people.

Talk to your friends and family and ask them to (honestly!) describe your personality. Take notes.

What were you good at in school/college (it doesn’t matter if you liked it or not)?
What have you been good at in the jobs you’ve had throughout your life?
What matters to you the most when it comes to a career/job: The salary? The hours?
The work environment? Doing something you excel at?

Your Passion
Be flexible. A study by Stanford psychologists found that most people have the mistaken belief that a passion is something you find easy to do. When people pursued their passion and encountered challenges, they gave up. The researchers further studied mindsets about interests in an experiment where a group of students who identified as “techie” or “artsy” were given two articles to read, one tech related and the other related to the humanities.

Students who had a fixed mindset about their interests were less open to reading an article that was outside their area. Unfortunately, focusing one one area could prevent you from finding your passion, which could happen when you bring different fields together, when you see connections between fields that you might not have thought of before.

A Growth Mindset is More Likely to Lead to Your Passion
In another experiment, researchers showed students an interesting video about the origin
of the universe. Most students were fascinated. Then they were asked to read a
challenging scientific article on the same topic. A lot of students lost their initial
excitement and the ones whose enthusiasm for the topic dropped completely were those
who had a fixed mindset about their interest. People who may be interested in a subject
can change their mind when it becomes too challenging.

“Develop” Instead of “Find”
Researchers concluded that “Developing your Passion” is more appropriate than “Finding
Your Passion,” because development requires commitment, seeing things through even
when they become difficult.

Another path to your passion can be developing valuable skills that will lead to greater
career satisfaction because you’ll be financially stable and more likely to develop a passion
for a field you’ve cultivated deep expertise in. In other words, first establish the lifestyle you
want for yourself and then fit a career around your vision. First get your basic needs taken
care of by creating a plan for your life and part of that plan is the development of your
Passion.

Passion Still Requires Discipline
But no matter which approach you choose to follow, you will never develop your passion if you keep switching directions and following every shiny object that crosses your path.

Even if they have a natural talent, ballet dancers invest years of discipline and hard work on their passion. So do athletes. So do millionaires. And so will YOU.

Now step back and look at the big picture.
Is your passion something you can incorporate into your career/job?

Is it something you will be doing on your personal time, after you do your work at a job that is just FINE; it’s not your passion, but it allows you to live well and pursue your passion? "

4528,Anyone who realized that what they want to do in life is completely different from what they studied in college? How did you go about it?,"I haven't been on this in years, but it just so happened that I was checking my email in regards to something directly related to this and saw the notification for this thread. I went to school for Criminal Justice/Forensic Science, became a cop, etc. I love the job but I always wanted be involved in STEM field, ever since I was younger. Instead of wasting more time and possibly regretting it later on, I am going back to school for Mechanical Engineering Technology with a minor in physics. In other words, chase your dreams no matter your age. It's never too late. I'm only 27, but I'm starting over from scratch because I know it will be worth it later on. "
4529,Do others around the age of 30 struggle with career direction?,"It sounds like you are unhappy with the other parts of your life (like being lonely) and career doesn't affect that.

It is easy to say that a career is why you aren't happy with your life, but it really comes down to your priorities - if you had been looking harder you could have found the wife at 22, etc.

It's not a binary.  You can make $50k and date more.  You can make time for a hobby, for a passion, to diet, to do whatever you want to do.

But you have to put as much effort into those as you have for a job, and you've put more effort into that. "

If the boss is needy and wants to be highly engaged, that is annoying, even if I like them personally.  I don't agree with the ""people don't leave a company, they leave a boss"" statement at all.  I've had several ""bad"" bosses that were for the most part easily ignored.  Usually I left a job because I got a better offer somewhere else. "
4535,Would it be strange if I brought a note pad and took notes on the first day of work?,"I’ll be the minority here and say that note pads don’t work for me.

I’d rather put all my focus on watching and learning. It usually doesn’t fall out of memory, and when it does, I correct it and it never happens again.

The note pad leads to having them wait for me to finish my notes AND it’s another thing to focus on.

Lots of times they’ll talk while I take notes. Doesn’t help for me. "
4536,"Lost in job hunt and life, what the hell do I do now?","In my head I was thinking you could just work through these points one at a time. Don't rush don't be overwhelmed and continue to ask for help like you did here!

1) Right now get any job if you don't have one. We all hate these jobs; I know.

2) As a side hustle consider advertising your labour skills. ""Will mow your lawn for $30!"" on FB market place and other groups or websites. Try to get as many cash jobs as you can. This is you starting to generate your own life prospects!

3) Keep applying for that dream job and the jobs that are step below that one!

4) Write a new cover letter for every job you apply to.

5) Have some HR people review your resume. The resume gets you in the door for an interview.

6) Review your interview skills and presentation. Again ask some HR people for tips. Always dress the part for the job you are interviewing for.

7) Volunteer for any non-profit organizations related to your career. These people can become good networking for insider job postings and references.

8) Build your professional social network like LinkedIn. As you connect to new people offer to help and never expect anything back. In time the right connections will surface to help you.

9) Start a blog or youtube channel based on your career. Wildlife is amazing! Start talking to your kids about wildlife and they will give you ideas for your blogs or videos. When recruiters and hiring managers see your blogs and videos they will see someone passionate for the industry. Your blog posts could be just part of LinkedIn if you don't have website skills. "
4537,"""We've decided not to fill this position at this time."" Has anyone been getting these emails more frequently given the whole coronavirus situation?","My people never called or emailed 🤣

I'm sure they knew I knew 

I'm not mad at them 

At the Trumpkins tho... "
4538,Why is being human so frowned upon in the corporate world?,"It's not universal, but it's certainly true of some companies. 

The thing that individuals forget, however, is that they have choice.  They do not have to stay working for these employers.  Particularly in the West, there is a multitude of options. 

If more people realised this and took action as a result, companies would be forced to change or risk losing their employees. 

Control what you can control.  You can't easily control a corporate culture so, if you don't like it, find one you do.  They are out there and changing jobs is something you can control. "
4539,"I've been unhappy with my job for a while and was looking to leave at this time, but now I feel stuck because of COVID. What are some good ideas to consider moving forward?","I am in the exact same situation as you are, except I already have a second interview planned and I am now really doubting whether I should even bother doing the interview at all.

&#x200B;

So I cannot advise you, because I am going through the exact same thing. I hope you decide what turns out best for you. I personally find that working from home makes my current job slightly more tolerable and makes me less prone to burn out. "
4540,Mid 30’s feel like I wasted my time studying for something I’m not working in. Am I alone in this?,"Youre not alone. I had a good friend once. She is in her early 30s now. She came from Kazakhstan back in 2013-ish to follow the american dream. She worked from fast food restaurants to high end NYC bar-tending etc. She already had a degree from Khazakstan but it was one of those liberal arts degree. So at the age of 29, she went to college and go her masters in math or something like that. At this time she was still working in those dead beat jobs (as in no future of anything). She cried all the time about not accomplishing her american dream.

ive done my part as a good friend to guide her but she just wont stay put. Shes very ""rushy"" and didnt have patience. Shes now a teachers aid before Covid, thats not likely happening. 

any ways, I did what I could but would be then told to fuck off because i didnt do enough. I felt bad at the same time for her but didnt. She just made poor decisions. She wanted to go back to school and get another degree. (since it was free cuz of her status or something idk). I told her it was unnecessary but she stuck to her belief. Im not sure what happened with her though now. Last I heard she was moving to LA (were in NYC) after covid eases down. I told her theres nothing in LA..but i got cursed out yet again. (i gave her insight on how it would be and how LA wont benefit her plan).

For instance folks my age (Gen X), only 1 in 10 are on track with retirement savings, factor in that many of their parents will outlive their retirement savings and this will be a huge burden that will last long after the college debt crisis we will see growing in the next decade.  Focus on buying a house once you’re settled in with work and life, try not to get caught in the trap of trying to keep up with the Joneses or that Insta influencer, buy a car you can afford to pay off in 4 years and drive it til the wheels fall off, and lastly, contribute to a 401(k) up to the company match and put the rest you can afford to save into a Roth IRA.

4556,I YOLO quit my job - what is next?,"Why didn’t you search for another job while employed there? Better position, better team and shorter commute position and use your current one as a leverage during interview.

Walking out is so immature. At least tell them that you are quitting, no? I just hope that stock option you cashed is enough to survive on. Who knows how long it’ll take to land another job. Potential next employer find out that you walked out from your last job, they wouldn’t hire you. Don list that job on your resume.

Also don’t underestimate commuting hours. 4 hr of commuting is way too long and might be a factor in your poor performance. When assigned tasks are overwhelming, the mature thing to do is to talk to your management and tell them you are being spread thin before things get too out of hand. If you don’t tell them and ask for help, how would they know that you are being overworked? 

They don’t teach you how to interact with management or how to navigate corporate world in engineering program, but that’s important skill in working life. YOLO is in general a bad motto to encourage impulsive and irresponsible actions. "

I still write scripts but it is such a profound relief to not have to depend on it to pay the bills! I can still work on it in my free time and book days off if needed to advise directors! 

There's no shame in getting yourself financially stable. I think the myth of ""if you want it bad enough you'll fight for it!"" While well-meaning, can be dangerously misleading and unrealistic.

4572,"To those who have “made it”, can you share your background?","Late to the party but here it is:

Worked hard in high school to get into a good college.  Worked hard in college and worked internships to get into the nuclear field as an engineer.  Networked as much as I could from events during college and with fellow students to help land my first job.  Married my wife who was also studying engineering at my school. Pooled our incomes to pay off loans and heavily invest (like 70% of our income) for about 3-4 years.  Less extreme investing once we got our own place together with no roommates.  Now coasting with dual income and planning to be financially independent in about 12 years, we would both be just shy of 40 years old.  We might be able to do it faster, but we're not pushing too hard on it and making sure to enjoy our lives.  The key was definitely leveraging our income heavily with investments as early as possible.  We can seriously invest like 5% of our income and retire well before most people because of this.

My income is roughly $93k after annual bonus after 5 years experience. 

Wife's income is roughly $65k after 3 years experience.  She is not making as much as she should and we're working on getting here a bump.  Her first job was at a startup company and she just changed industries so she needs some experience to get a pay jump. "

That and consistency and authenticity. I feel like most people aren't zookeepers, and I'm sure you interact with lots of wonderful animals on a regular basis and have interesting things to show/talk about. Just document your journey as a zookeeper and put it out there! I think you really should check out TikTok right now and figure out how to use it. Hope this helps! "

look if a job have multiple interviews, they won't low ball your market value. plus i think its best to bring it up after they invested time into you first. (i.e. at the end)

Now is your chance to do something you’re passionate about, something exciting.  That may mean helping others, or it may mean another path.  

First you need to keep your lights on, food on your table, and to not be a burden yourself, on the public dole.  If you pursued a marginal value degree, think about what you might need to do to monetize it. Consider risk, and manage it - don’t run from it or run towards it.  Be smart. 

The greatest benefit to others will be when you have the time, resources and energy to put towards things that matter to you personally.  The bleeding heart, eating cat food and earning minimum wage, bless them for doing so, might not be the right path for everyone.  

And capitalism and creating “value” of different types isn’t the evil that the leftists would try to indoctrinate you into thinking. I agree with the sentiment of movie production or fashion.  But people, even the socialists who want to own more of people’s’ labor for supposed betterment, like that stuff. Entertainment, storytelling, fashion, these aren’t modern things - they’re ages old. They’re human nature. The fact that there’s so much money in that vs other greater challenges is indeed sad, but it’s humanity’s making, and it’s not going to change.  Best you can do is vote with your wallet and route your resources when you have them, elsewhere.

It’s an entry tool to help you interview but you need internships and jobs in related fields to get a job. 

The only career paths that might be related would be teaching and consulting. Teaching only requires a teachers license in most states and you would do fine in high school civics classes.

Collect all the evidence you can, start having preliminary meetings with company leadership, lay the foundation for a tougher conversation down the road. If you communicate to the powers that be this woman is toxic to the work culture, there is a chance they will choose harmony over her bullshit. Even better if other people at the company can attest to her bs.

Document everything you can. Worse comes to worse, your fighting back spurs her to fire you and you get unemployment plus you have a paper trail proving you tried to communicate her issues with you to leadership numerous times. "

If money motivated you go to finance and IB. Or if you just wanna hit that dollar amount, do software engineering. Keep in mind though - there's is no such thing as easy money. If you want to get paid 200k, you need to be doing 200k worth of work. If it was easy to make 200k/year, everyone would do it. "
4612,I got offered a new job which means I’m going to have to resign from my current role while in isolation.

That’s it really.

4614,What is 9-5 office culture like (specifically in large companies in big cities)?,"i worked in an office for 9 months, so i'd say i'm well qualified to answer your questions.

1) most of the people that did this were higher ups and as long as they got their work done, it was all good. sometimes they'd let another higher up that they'd be arriving later than usual, but it really wasn't that big of a deal.

2) i could usually take lunch anytime between 1pm-2pm. sometimes i'd have so much work to do that i'd take lunch past 2pm, but it didn't happen that often. i usually went for lunch at 1pm since it was much closer to 9am, but if i took lunch at 1:30pm or 2pm, it meant the rest of the day felt much shorter than it really was.

3) a lot of the people that were there for much longer than me went out for happy hour or to lunch/dinner, but since i was considered a new guy, i wasn't brought along. we did however have a lot of events in the office. these were usually for holidays or birthdays. people usually talked about whatever they wanted to talk about.

4) people did curse a lot, but it was only when they weren't talking to a customer or to a superior. 

5) i wasn't there long enough to witness any special traditions.

6) reading online reviews and the body language/vibe you get from the office helps a lot. the place i used to work at had open cubicles, so you could easily see everyone all at once. in general, the place was emotionless and it being cold on a near daily basis didn't help.

i'd say working in an office is just like any other job. as long as you keep your eyes, ears, and mouth shut during certain situations, you'll be good. a lot of people thrive on gossiping and stirring shit up, so just be careful of what you say and who you're saying it to. "

4631,I have made a huge mistake and switched to a new company mid-pandemic. I hate it. What should I do?,🤷🏻‍♂️ 
4632,Any advice for a 22 year old who still doesn’t know what they want to be when they grow up?,"First off 22 is young and there's time to change paths and even have several different careers.

It's worth it to take a little time to think about what you want to do, what kind of people you want to work with and in what setting.  There are a lot of books on this.  

The Myers Briggs type tests can help give some insight so you could search on ""INFP careers"".   I think this site might also be helpful: [https://www.careerexplorer.com](https://www.careerexplorer.com).  My guess is you would be happier in things like social work / psychology / nonprofit than in finance / sales / marketing type jobs.

As for money, probably if you stuck with social media marketing or business technology you could make a lot of money, but that doesn't mean you would be poor in helping professions like psychology / social work / nonprofit.  I know several people who are social workers or therapists that do quite well for themselves.   For those positions you're going to need graduate degrees and probably licenses.  I also know people that have been involved in nonprofits or ""corporate giving"" positions that have good (though not spectacular) salaries.

Since you're still in school take advantage of any academic and career advisors who can help you find direction.  I didn't do that much, had no clear career plan, and when I graduated floundered around for years.  So don't make that mistake.  Get on it .  There's still time. "
4633,"What jobs offer sufficient free time or time away from work, pay adequately, and are relatively enjoyable or low stress?","This is going to sound silly, I know. But maybe just learn how to day trade stocks and ETFs. 

The object of being American (unfortunately if only by proxy) is to make money. My coworkers put in ridiculous hours because they believe deep down that if they work hard and suffer, they’ll be rewarded later.

Ive been red pilled long enough on this issue to know the only likely reward is health issues and unhappiness.

As vapid as the concept is, trading money for more money skips all the bullshit you’d otherwise endure in a day job. 

Just be sure to learn the shit out of technical analysis before even stepping foot into the field. "
4634,How far would you let a job mentally break you before you quit?,"Nothing has the power to break me unless I allow it. 

Always have another job to go to before you quit. "
4635,How do I find what I love to do to make a career out of?,Listen to the song Sunscreen with Baz Luhrmann. I am similar to you and it helps to provide some perspective. 
4636,How can I make my boss understand how overworked I am?,Bow down to your capitalist overlord! 
4637,"How do I say ""I want a chill job"" without using those words?","I don't think you should be telling them what you want so much as looking for the right environment and then selling your skills to them.  If you say something like ""I want a chill job"" you might seem lazy.

So look for a company / job that is not as fast paced and then apply for a job there.

You might want to look at large corporations, government agencies or nonprofits.  Probably best to avoid advertising, tech or any startups. "
4638,How can I navigate my education in a society that deems so many degrees to be worthless?,Become a web developer. 
4639,"As a Young Professor, How Should I Deal With Disrespect From Older Professors?","You're expecting respect when normally you have to earn it first.

4642,"Bosses: What are the differences between your best employees and ""the rest""?","I like the people who are proactive, who don't complain, who show initiative and I can trust to give broad instructions to without having to micromanage. "
4643,Why do recruiters think it's acceptable to be so aggressive?,"Do you want a job or not?

It is literally their job to get you signed up and placed in a role before other agencies do. That is how they make money. 

Does that help, "
4644,How do you succeed in business as a shy/introverted person?,"Be attractive, don't be unattractive. "
4645,My dad just lost his job again - how can I support him?,He’s prolly too bummed out for food. Take it upon yourself to update his resume the apply for jobs for him. 
4646,Is it normal to not receive a raise after 10 years when your salary is the industry average?,"Well, is this the first time your mother has asked for a raise? Then that’s why she hasn’t gotten one.  That said, can she look for other RN jobs?  Business is business and no, no one wants to pay your mom more if they can pay someone else less.  In terms of offering her $1 more per hour, that’s about a standard yearly raise, they’re not going to make a jump unless they have to, she should delicately ask for more, but in general be looking for another opportunity where she could make a larger jump in salary, as an RN she could be a lot higher by now. "
4647,My work expects me to literally sit and do nothing most of the day. How do I handle this?,A friend of mine runs code verification. Sometimes while he runs those verifications he plays games on his phone complete with headphones.  Sometimes the verification can take an hour to run. $100k a year for a few hours a day work. 
4648,Would you rather take a long commute for a super desirable job or take a satisfactory job within walking distance?,"I’d go for the long commute. Your chance of being happy will be higher. That’s me, anyway. "
4649,"I have applied to 80 jobs on Linkedin, and have gotten ZERO responses. What am I doing wrong?","To be fair, the economy is not too good right now. I'd stay at your current company. "
4650,Is anyone else completely averse to brown-nosing?,"Usually morals and money don’t go hand in hand. I can’t stand a blatant ‘teachers pet’ brown noser, however we’ve all got bills to pay and trying to keep your boss happy is usually a good step to make sure the money train keeps on rollin’. "
4651,Has anyone lost all drive in their career (and life) due to a highly mundane job? Did you get it back once moving on?,I have been told that moving into a different career would be difficult because it wouldn't be as high-stress. Someone just advised me to make a weighted pro-con list before making big deciscions- and you don't have to make the choice right now. Good luck! 
4652,"To the peoole with their life more together, how did you come across that ""ahHA"" moment where you knew what you wanted to do for the rest of your life?","The rest of your life will hold many chapters and changes. Look for a career path that won’t die out as you progress through them. Pick a few areas of interest and then assess the growth trajectory. I went to work in solar with the goal of a diverse, long term career. So far 5 years in to my career I’ve worked in a variety of rewarding rolls for the same employer. The industry is changing at an mind blowing pace, every single day brings an opportunity to learn and grow. Building your career in high growth industry will lead you to opportunities you can’t even fathom as possible right now.

Also - consider what you want as a lifestyle outside of work!!!!! For example someone who values regular family and social time might not be happy as a train conductor,  hours are random and long often conflicting with other plans. 

Finally, learn a trade. Again, LEARN A TRADE. Electricians and plumbers make ridiculous money and there are not enough people entering the trades to replace those retiring. "
4653,Am I wrong to want a job with decent vacation?,Become a teacher and your vacation time will be 2-3 months! 
4654,Is Corona virus affecting the job market? & Any excel learning advice?,"I'm trying to make the switch into I.T. I don't know if I should apply or wait, all I'm looking for are contract or temp tech support jobs. "

4661,"My first year sales goal was 200k, and I’ve reached 1.1 million in 9 months, how do I communicate this with my boss and/or use it to my advantage while exploring more established companies to apply to?","Make sure he knows that you can easily leave for a high salary, and show him how your absence would hurt the company. 

He already wants to retire, so make a plan that makes him money AND gets him to retire. 

Do you respect the owner? Is he old and tired of working, or young and wants to retire early? If the former then I wouldn’t waste my time unless you really respect him. If he’s a good, honest boss he’ll know that losing you is not in his interest. 

Good luck! "

4687,"Very tempted to quit my job without a new job lined up, am I justified in my reasoning or is it all in my head?","The reason they hired this senior guy that is barking orders?  Because they needed someone who was a leader and you weren't stepping into that role.

That's why you didn't get promoted and that's why this guy who barks orders is there.

Be assertive, and propose solutions / plans instead of complaining there isn't one and you can quickly rise in chaotic companies.  Sit around and complain that it's disorganized and you'll miss those opportunities.

A failure in the upper levels is an opportunity to rise.  You rise by solving the problem, not pointing out the problem.

4690,How do you overcome GPA gatekeeping?,"Lie about it. It’s GPA, it’s not as big of a deal as the companies that are doing the hiring think it is.

4692,"I don't want to work for the corporate world, how do I fulfill this?","I genuinely thank and appreciate everyone that has given me advice so far, I did not expect this post to blow up the way it did.

I will try and summarize my opinion based on everyone's responses in this comment.

**SE Freelancing:** I love this idea, but is it realistic to do in a developing country, and if anyone has experience with it please let me know

**Teaching abroad:** Teaching abroad does sound nice, but it eliminates the benefit of being able to have my own freedom to vacation. The other major downside is the pay, because one great thing of working in the US is the currency exchange in other countries.

**Startups:** This is one of my favorite ideas and I have never thought of doing this yet, I love the idea of being part of something small and making it grow. Dealing with the business behind it does excite me. This idea is really giving me passion to code and enjoy my studies again. Even if it the company does fail or go under I will still be able to get back on my feet fairly easy due to Software Engineers being needed.The one downside and the thing that makes me feel selfish for saying, is that I wouldn't be able to to just pickup and leave to another country when I wanted to.

I didn't fully mention the importance of leaving to a developing country. I want to live in one not only because I love the simplistic lifestyle, but I also because the money I would make here in the US goes much further. In a country such as Guatemala a 10k salary would be more than enough for a person to live comfortably and plane tickets are fairly inexpensive too. I feel that it is almost a loophole in life to use it as an economic advantage. I might get a little sting for saying something a bit selfish, but I've met many people from such countries that would travel to the USA to work then send money back home to their families then return after they had saved enough.

4695,What are hiring managers and hr really looking for on a LinkedIn profile that the can't find on a resume?,"I don't disclose that I look. I review resumes, and if I'm getting ready to move someone onto the interview list, I look them up on facebook/linkedin. I'm looking for red flags like differences between their resume and linkedin. 

Believe it or not, I regularly find differences. It's usually because people are afraid to lie on their linkedin, because they have past coworkers in their network. Those same people are often all too willing to fib on the resume though.

For facebook, I'm looking at thinks like how you communicate. Do you speak clear proper english? Do you speak in slang? Do you use punctuation and proper spelling? 

Lastly, I'm looking at recent posts and pictures. This gives me a snapshot of your personality. Are you a party animal? Is your profile pic a pot leaf? Are you constantly arguing with people about politics or drama? It's such a good way to weed out terrible candidates.

Edit: If you're going to downvote, at least say why. They were looking for info from actual hiring managers and HR staff. You may personally not like that prospective employers look at social media, but it doesn't make it any less true, or worth downvoting so it isn't seen. "

But it is childish of you to be upset about something so significantly that you would leave without telling your boss your frustration.

What you should do is consult a legal counselor for employment to help you out of this situation as it is not possible for anyone of us out here to give you the best solution. Dont think of going for another job as again you will end up facing similar scenario. Deal with the current situation, as it completely depends on organization to organization and how they handle such situations. If consulting a counselor is not what you are looking for then try talking to your bosses about the issue straight up, no middlemen and discuss with them the condition you are currently going through. Hopefully they might respond positively.

All the best "

You could always switch later and find your true passion in life. Life ain’t bout money at the end of day. But money gonna bring some clarity. If you don’t know what to do just continue what’s your doing and get that bred. You got all the time in the world. Me and you.  I don’t know what I’m gonna do in life. But all I know is that I don’t want to work 40 hours a week and wait 20 years for a promotion just for like 10k extra and a office. You feel me. I only got one goal.

4715,What is the difference between studying Applied Statistics vs Data Science vs Data Analytics vs Business Analytics?,"There's much debate but I think data science is almost the same as applied stats, just that there's more focus on computationally-intensive models like machine learning rather than traditional statistics.  The methods/computers get better but the mathematical foundation gets fuzzier.

Business analytics isn't really a field.  It's important to hone in on whether a role is really like data science/analysis vs ""BI engineering"" which is more like data cleaning and database admin.

On multiple occasions, I didn’t get a good feeling from my first interview and changed my mind in the second interview. It’s not like the hiring manager is going to be your direct boss. The position may be more appealing once you learn more about the position. Hiring managers tend to know very little about the actual position and what it would entail.

4719,How to learn soft skills?,"Meds + exercise are a great way to increase dopamine and endorphins and then you don’t have to fake anything, you’ll actually like and be excited about talking to people.

4723,Why do people advise not to put in your 100% effort at work?,"I understand why some say that you should not, however from experience I recommend you always give 100% no matter what anyone else is doing because it speaks to your integrity and level of excellence, however you must learn how to pitch yourself and transition your career to advance whether in your department, unity, organization, or outside of it. 

You must take time to observe, ask questions, and understand the culture of your company or else you may be the workhorse of the office/unit without any benefit.  Look for problems to solve and give feedback on how to solve them.  You can move up quickly just by doing that consistently.  #movingonup

4735,Any graduate still applying for jobs/finding it hard to get a job?,"Graduated last year with a ba in psychology, with a biology minor.  First “real” job after graduation (i.e., not working food or retail) Just left job due to health reasons "
4736,Ever apply for a job just to see if you get an interview?,"I don't even get interviews for jobs I'd actually want and be good at, so why bother trying elsewhere. "
4737,Want a way to get in the door to your dream job?,The other way to go about it is by contacting people in that organization through LinkedIn. 
4738,"I’m not very good at my job, and I’m failing. How do I get out with my reputation intact?","Why does everyone feel they need to list every single job on their resume? Who is asking for gaps in resumes these days? I only list the relevant work experience for the jobs I apply for. I've also gotten the same feedback from recruiters.

If you're not happy, leave. You owe nothing to any company. "
4739,I am 40 and cannot read due to disability. Just lost my job. Can you suggest a good path forward before I lose my house and family?,Run for city council in Seattle - clearly they’re all blind too. 
4740,Can't get hired because I have no experience; can't get experience because I can't get hired. Advice for newly graduated writer?,"Have you considered doing something else and writing on the side? You’ll have an income, and real world experience to write about. It’s how a lot of writers (Chuck Palahniuk is my favorite example) get their start. "
4741,What is the fastest way to kickstart my life as a 31 yo who wasted his life so far but wants to do whatever means necessary?,"*""My target is to work hard for 2-4 years and make some substantial savings that would allow me to stop working or work part time while pursuing my degree (and be able to pay for all the fees involved).""*

I don't think that's very realistic. If you set yourself up with this starting mindset, you are doomed to fail when you hit 5 years and realize you're nowhere near your goal. 

Seems like your best bet would be a pyramid scheme. "
4742,I got the pass to Work From Home full-time! How do I make the best of this?,"Everyone seems to have already given you some really good advice. So, i’ll just leave this [WFH advice](https://youtu.be/KGg1567fzTY) "
4743,Is it okay to quit a job if its causes high anxiety? I cant deal with rejecting sick animals.,My psychiatrist refused me to quit a job without another job/project. I would recommend you to speak to a professional (a médecine doctor) about your problems to find solutions. He/she could also prescript you medication for stress/anxiety. Maybe you could ask your n+1/collègues how to deal with angry customer. Have a nice day 
4744,Does anyone here experience imposter syndrome?,"Yes! I was asked to do a webinar in my field and I was terrified I was going to give info people already knew and sound like an idiot. Well I got the feedback after and it was far from that. I realized I needed to stop doubting myself and that I am a subject matter expert in my field. I'm not Janet from The Good Place, so it's okay if I don't know everything. "
4745,Do people really enjoy their careers?,Yeah it's almost all vets in the PD. I did IT work for a police department in Florida. They  it was really something special to watch them work. The military will give you an amazing array of skills and you can switch trade of most/rates while your in. 
4746,What is your opinion of a person at work that is very quiet?,[deleted] 
4747,"When the job ad says 'tell us about yourself', what kind of information do they want to hear?","Lie. They don't give a shit what you do in your personal time. If they ask, lie and say you read books listening to jazz. Or soak in the tub reading your favorite book sipping wine lol I've always answered with I've been in medical records for about 7 years. I graduated college in 2012 with 2 degrees in medical billing and coding as well as health IT and moved back to my home state of Az and basically started my career there. I've been in medical records ever since for the most part. I've lived in CO about 2 years now.  I've got a wide range of experience from home health, to small clinics to a large hospital to pediatrics. I've worked with over 10 EMRs and experienced in word, excel, outlook and IE. My schedule is flexible and I love medical records. Bam. "
4748,My manager doxxed me to another leadership member regarding a feedback I provided anonymously. Now the colleague confronted me and this did some damage to my workplace relationships. How do I handle this?,"Amazing how these people can get away this.  Are they literally asking for a workplace shooting?  Because this is how they happen, especially in these hysterically choatic times we are all in.  Whipping people up into a bloody frenzy is certainly in the air, make no mistake about it.  If your feedback was anonymous, was there any non-disclosure agreement or confidentiality statement to the effect that all answers will be kept confidential and anonymous?  If there was any breach of that, SUE. "
4749,"How do you network when you’re reserved, shy, and closed-off?","I recommend listening to Jordan Peterson on YouTube regarding small talk. In order to pull this off I believe it's a two pronged approach: mentally and physically.

Physically: I recommend taking some 5-HTP and St. John's wort supplements which help calm your nerves. I just started taking them and they've really helped alleviate my mood. Don't drink beer because that's classified as a depressant and will make things worse.

Mentally: Approach these events with a challenge mindset instead of a something you're afraid of. Be ready to take some losses and disappointments but don't let that be the focus. Instead, focus on how many positive exchanges you get. You only need 1 to be successful. You can do this by focusing on them not you! Small talk is not fake, it's a necessary little game for all of us to find out if someone is worth investing more into. 

Good luck! Let me know if my tips help 😊 "
4750,How do you shut off work-brain and turn on life-brain?,"If you’re constantly thinking about work, you seem to enjoy it. Embrace this fact to your advantage, your skills learned from your job has opened your eyes in a way not many people can see "
4751,What are some relatively quick skills/certificates to learn/earn that look good in any career?,What's a good hr cert for someone trying to go into hr? Already have a B.S. in Criminal Justice. Trying to get into the career then further my education with a better work schedule. 
4752,I feel like I’ve failed at 26. Is there a way forward?,Hm 
4753,How do some people change careers so easily?,"Being a woman, attractive and very social, helps.

&#x200B;

You can easily say ""hey why don't we do this?"", and you probably will have a person supporting you emotionally. This in turn leads to increased confidence (makes you seem like you know what you talk about) which helps secure funding to pay an actual expert to do stuff. "
4754,What are some quiet careers where you work alone or with less social interaction?,Hacker 
4755,"Which jobs allow extreme flexibility, good pay, and very little work?",[removed] 
4756,Will I get blacklisted for reserving my legal rights with a would-be employer?,Gasoline and a match 
4757,How long did it take you make $50k/yr? $80k? When would you say you felt comfortable financially and what should new workers know today?,"70k first year.
80k second year.

In South.

If you're jealous, teach your kids to code. "
4758,Low stress and flexible jobs?,Retail maybe? 
4759,"Am I scaring off employers when i tell them what I currently earn? How do you properly answer ""Whats your expected salary"" question?","I always say something like ""I'm looking for something comparable to the market based on my experience and skills."" "
4760,Is there a time limit before one HAS to take on a leadership position in order to stay relevant and hireable?,"No, there's no time limit. Most stay in new jobs two years before getting promoted or before they start looking for a new job. Of course, this is for the people who want a leadership role. 

To answer your second question, its very possible to specialize very early on. I have a friend who found mid-level job with entry-level experience. She received all of her certifications prior to and went for it. She's doing very well and has been there for a year now. 

Choose a career that comes natural. It will supersede all credentials. "
4761,I recently accidentally found out that I'm going to be terminated this week or next week (sometime soon) through an email that wasn't meant for me. What should I do about this?,You should have made your condition known before being hired. 
4762,What's an online degree that's not extremely expensive and will actually get you a job? I'm thinking maybe a finance or computer science degree?,ASU- supply chain  
4763,Unpaid trial period for a job I might not even get - Is this a waste of my time?,"If your good at something, never to it for free. That said, if your not doing anything at the moment, being able to say your still working in the field by volunteering, that's got to earn you some points.. "
4764,How to choose a career?,Just read Kerouac and you won’t have to 
4765,Is it in poor taste to leave your current job for an hour to go interview at another job?,"poor, yes. so is your company not at poor taste? no. "
4766,What to do when you have little passion?,"Stop trying to search so hard for a passion.

You’ll miss it otherwise; get on with your shit. Focus on your loved ones.

I’m sure you’re doing a fantastic job man.

You will not find what you’re looking for; work is hard, as it should be.

You should love yourself because you are willing to work despite the hardship of having to work to live. That’s virtuous. "
4767,Did changing your career path turn out the way you wanted?,"What is your current career ?

If its in healthcare or IT then you'll be better off staying there. Only thing better would probably be an  IT specialist in healthcare or a healthcare specialists in IT. 

If your not then getting ready financially, morally , spiritually,mentally and physically. 

This pandemic is just the pin that has pricked the bubble that we call our economy. Its not the pandemic we have to worry about its the next depression.

This lockdown and fear of the pandemic is going to permanently change spend habits. People will start to spending less and saving more. Some people mistakenly think that a 401k is equivalent to saving. However they will soon realize that a 401k just a stock market casino where the investor always loss and 'they' always wins. Even with the recent stock market dip it has long way to fall. Life savings will as a result vanish. Also as customers start spending less and investors flee stocks, companies will start shutting down . Layoffs will increase while incomes and tax revenues decline.  A positive feedback loop will be created when enough unemployed stop spending money in other industries. This means more bankrupt businesses and more unemployment. 
 
Governments are powerless. Since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008 the government have shot their last silver bullets. By lowered interest rates on loans to Zero in an attempt to stimulate economic activity for the last 10 years this has  allowed millions of people and businesses to get into massive amount of debt. This also has allowed the wealthy to stay in business to provide jobs for the poor so that they could feed their hungry children ( or do drugs) . But like drug addicts the economy IS addicted to these loans, because without it we will have to endure severe pain and suffering. A similar situation occured prior to the GFC where too many  un-credit worthy people and businesses got loans on homes they cant afford. ( Thank the irresponsible boomer generation for that)

However theres still hope. The government has a pocket knife left! 😆

Because now the Federal Reserve( the only privately owned bank in the USA that is allowed by law to print money for it self) is planning to make NEGATIVE rates.  This means that banks will start handing out. 💸 bonus for those willing to borrowing MORE money. Those Genius. Lol.  But Of Course only the "" Essential""  will ever get that money, because we all know the propaganda that some of us are more equal the the rest of us.😥.  If this happens then we might as well change our country name to the United Communists of America.

Negative interest rates is the equivalent of throwing a gun at a grizzly bear  after you've shot all your bullets and then attacking it head first with a pocket knife. May the US dollar and all your life savings RIP. 😇any ways thanks for reading. And may God save our souls. 😳 "
4768,How do I give my two week notice while my supervisor is working from home?,Does your boss have a boss?  It may be best to email your boss and his boss since he's out on this.  That way your organization has been informed by someone in the chain. 
4769,How did you guys decide what you want to be in life? A few days ago was my 22nd birthday and it was a reminder that I still don't know what I want as a career.,"If you don’t know what to do, get any job, save and travel.
Spend your 20’s travelling.
An easy way to do this is become an English teacher you can travel Asia and South America working in schools. It’s a great way to see the world. 
It takes like a year to get qualified. "
4770,"People who had a hard time getting full time work after college, what are you doing now?",All these comments prove my point I constantly try to tell people college isn't it worth it 70% of time. Lucky to have been in that 30%. High schools need to stop pushing college so much. 
4771,"My boss told me there was no growth for me at the company. After putting in my notice, they posted a job position in a position one-rank above me. Advice?",So apply to it and let your boss know you applied. 
4772,Did I miss my window of getting a “big girl job”?,I’m 27 and know that I could change it up for myself and not actually be too old or missing the window. You are young and have plenty of time to figure it out. 
4773,"Should I (25f) take the easy route and study library science, or the exciting, difficult route and try forensic science?","Library science lol I never heard of that before, what modules do you study ? How to beep book, how to put book, how to shhhhhh. "
4774,"Recruiter answer to apology email: ""Can I ask why? ""","I'd normally give people the benefit of the doubt (using a phone, less formal) but they're a recruiter so probably a twat. "
4775,Lack of Confidence during Interview.. Help?,"I was in a similar position as you: if you're not getting secondary interviews, I highly recommend reaching out to your alumni and ask for your referral (to prevent your resume to get relegated to the bin). Or, you could also reach out to current employees at LinkedIn (the company I would apply) and asking what exactly is it they do. That helps you to know what to expect in interviews and prepare your answers accordingly. If you're interested in tech, this compilation of [interviews](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16y6KaU3Dhb--dqS1KHvRLMdIVkmHirCC/view) of people working at Google/Amazon/LinkedIn could be useful. Good luck!! "
4776,Teaching is an extremely difficult job that doesn’t pay well financially or emotionally. Should I leave education and follow my dream of becoming the first lawyer in my family? Or should I fight the good fight and stay in education?,"Foul language and bad behavior is ""extremely difficult""? Tell that to the oilfield workers, miners, plumbers, and even fast food cashiers. I dare you. Lmao, teaching is a cushy gig. "
4777,What does an exit interview usually entail?,"Politely communicate why you think your boss was a bad boss and is a reason for you leaving. It can improve the situation for your old team, even though you won't be there. HR is supposed to be able to look at your feedback objectively. They want to know who sucks at being a boss, from the mouths of people who work(ed) under them. "
4778,How do you maintain healthy boundaries with coworkers?,"A contrary example is to, as a manager, invite some of your favorite subordinates to your wedding (even those that you don't hang out with outside the office) but don't invite all your subordinates.

This happened...to a friend. "
4779,How can I address or handle new boss making fun of me on social media?,This sounds like a job for HR! 
4780,(advice from an exec. recruiter) Curious why you aren't being called back after an interview?,[deleted] 
4781,"Former career coach just sent out an promotional email blast using my name, image, and personal struggles with my employer/job and my boss just forwarded it to me and wants to meet. What should I say to him and what should I do next?",own it 
4782,How does one go about looking for a job while already in a VERY demanding full time position?,I just went through this and I basically took time off to make sure I was available for interviews or I would call out sick. 
4783,Is it ok to ask about salary during an interview?,Avoid. 
4784,How to gracefully hand in your two weeks?,Why turn in your to weeks why not just quit ? 
4785,I have had a job that I hate and finally saved enough to change my career but realized I don't have any dreams left... What now?,"If you and your husband can afford to have children with you staying at home as a fulltime mom.. then that would be by far the best ""career"" choice. 

There is nothing more fulfilling and worthwhile then raising your own children.  

Jobs or careers are for the majority of humans, hollow empty pursuits that siphon your time and wellbeing for a paycheck that provides just enough money to keep you alive, and tied to the machine till you're ground to a pulp. "
4786,"People who jumped from a stable and good work environment to pursue a higher salary and prestige, how did that go for you?","Reverse for me. My first job after uni was two years ago, worked for that company for 1.5 years, earned 45k per year. However, due to organisation-wide inefficiencies, I was working my ass off doing a lot of different thing out of necessity. If I didn't do it, nobody else would. Main office refusing to take accountability for their actions and they don't listen, in addition to a revolving door culture. I had 7 people leave and be replaced during my 1.5 years working there out of 9 people. 

Left that job because I was offered a job at my current company and now earn 55k a year and work 40 hours a week only (compared to 50 to 80 hours at it's worst). Couldn't be happier with this choice, now I have people who appreciate what I do and they aren't gaslighting me about their decisions. "
4787,"32 yo, too late to start a career?","35. 2016 was the worst year of my life. I'm starting over in retial. Your not the only one. I'm not the only one, it's this world and economy. "
4788,"I have no ""passion"". Should I just follow a path which is a mix of: what I may be good at, money, ""so good that they can't ignore you"" and personality fit?","Just fucking try shit, man. That's where I am. I hang drywall because it pays super well here in MT (I started at $20/hr for 40-50hrs per week), but when school starts again in the fall, I am heading back 3 days a week to try chem out, because I really enjoy certain aspects of it and dont want to be helplessly arthritic at 45. "
4789,Not rehired as a teacher- what else can I do?,"I would check with other school districts.  Assuming you aren’t a horrible teacher, science teachers are always in short supply at least in the districts near me (my sister is a teacher). "
4790,"What's the best way to say: ""I can't start working here until I put in my two week notice at my current job""?",Just start working fully remote. When you feel happy with it give your two week notice. Unless you have overlapping meeting hours it works great. 
4791,How do you survive the 9-5 grind?,"It sounds like your not as interested in your woek as you think you are. If anything in 100 years down the line people will be looking at 9-5 as minor, its really not a lot of work compared to what a lot of people do. In fact its the bare basic.

Again, i would try and hone in on your passions and keep trying until you finf something you love. If you ever start your own business or pursue a passion like you suggested, your going to be working a whole lot longer than 9-5... "
4792,I’m on furlough and I want to move to a different city where I’ve always wanted to settle and ask if I could work remotely when I’m called back to work. Should I go for it?,I wouldn’t count on it. They’d probably hand you an ultimatum saying come to the office or you’re fired. 
4793,"All I feel I care about is escapism, what am I to do?",Have you tried meditation for a good couple weeks every day? It could help develop your intuitive clarity to discover some ideas. 25-30min a day 
4794,Sent a complaint in to HR about my supervisor...his boss is thrilled about it?,"From now on, keep your fucking head down.

If the guy gets fired, that's on him not on you, but everyone else is going to think you're a back stabber. If he doesn't get fired he's going to come back at you. "
4795,"I feel like I'm being ""edged out"" of my job by a new employee. Toxicity everywhere. Should I look for new employment?",Keep things positive but yes look for a new job and work on your interview skills so you can weed out bad employers. 
4796,Is Linkedin Absolutely Necessary for Networking?,Nobody else wants to tell OP to work on their English? 
4797,"I am close to hitting 1.5 years of graduating college and not doing anything related to my degree. Currently, I'm in a dead end job. Where do I go from here?",Why did you decide to screw yourself? 
4798,Found out I’m pregnant before my 90 days is up. Now what?,"It's all about trust. If you want trust afterwards say it, whatever it‘ll cause to your career.
If you don‘t give a heck about the consequences of hiding your pregnancy, go ahead and lie. 
  
My wife was in the same situation and she didn‘t loose her job. It‘s an amazing company that base job relationship trhough trust. 
  
Trust is the keyword, choose. 
  
At the end you will have your baby anyway and you will be happy whatever you will decide. 
  
BTW, crongratulations! "
4799,"Received offer from 2nd choice employer, have an interview with 1st choice tomorrow. How do I approach this?",Almost very company gives you time to decide. You always ask for even more no matter how much longer they give you. Aim for 2 weeks. That will give you time. 
4800,Career change for an extreme introvert who's tired of programming?,"I was very introverted until maybe around age 25.  I made it a point to approach strangers in public and talk with them.  When I first started, I had so much anxiety about it, I could barely get my words out at times.  I was especially terrified of talking with attractive women.  But I slowly made progress with each conversation and became faster on my feet and more confident in a conversation.

Couple the above with my love of writing code, and I love my career as a Software Engineer.  Collaboration is absolutely necessary in this field.  Nobody specifies the work you need to do perfectly such that you can avoid having discussions about it.  It’s not possible because PMs don’t know what you know about what’s possible and how difficult potential future work will be.

I’d take the same path if I were you.  Learn to care about others as human beings who are facing their own struggles.  And practice talking to them in a way you both find interesting.

A good starting place is the book “How to Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie.  If you’ve already read it, read it again periodically.  You’ll see (or hear, if you prefer audiobooks) something new each time.

Best of luck. "
4801,How do I learn Office Politics/Optics skills as a beginner?,Just wait. You’ll hear them other employees talking soon enough young Juan 
4802,"28F , recovering addict , 3 time felon...What can I realistically do with my life?","If I might dare to be honest, I would never hire you, not even for caretaking in the office, not as a temp, and certainly not for a full time position. It’s not a personal thing, it’s a risk thing. Felons are liabilities no matter how good they are at a job or how wonderful they are as people. The felon May not pose a risk themselves, but their status as a felon will always be a risk. If something goes wrong and their status comes out, we’re left holding the bag, regardless of whether or not their status had any relevance to the event. 

Just as you are being smart and realistic about the unlikeliness of being hired if you pursue higher education, you might also consider that even if you work your way up in a place that will hire you and you like it there, management shuffles over time and one day you might get someone like me in the company who will see your HR file and make it clear to the higher-ups that you have to be contained (because we probably can’t fire you if you already work there). Depending on what the laws are where you’re working, we may not be able to fire you, but we can flag you and basically end your career advancement (I know it’s not fair). Either way, it would be unfortunate for you, and eventually you wouldn’t want to work there anymore. Because risk follows you, your manager would be instructed not to provide a reference. 

I wonder though if you would be a good candidate for running your own business, or running one with someone else? A small business environment with very little hierarchy (ie, very few, if any, people like me) would also be a good bet I think. Either be the boss or be close to the boss—that’s probably a real good bet for you. Plenty of people with tarnished pasts do well when they’re not being cock-blocked by risk-averse, white collar folk like myself. 

If you can ever pursue a pardon, I highly encourage you to do so. 

I wish you the very best. It sounds like you know how to keep at it. Good luck—and sorry for being so blunt. "

How to Find and Develop Your Passion in Life

How do people find their passion? That thing that makes them get out of bed every morning
excited to face the day? Did they always know what it was or did they learn later in life?

First of all, your passion is not necessarily going to be what you do for a living. You can be
great at your job even if it’s not what your passionate about. So let’s divide this exercise into
two parts: FINDING YOUR PASSION and FINDING A JOB YOU ARE OK WITH AND THAT
ENABLES YOU TO PURSUE YOUR PASSION. 

Take a Deep Breath
Before we begin we have to be aware that you’re going to feel some discomfort at some point during the exercise. Fear, insecurities, impostor syndrome, what ifs. That’s all normal because change is hard, you’ve probably been in your comfort zone of misery at your job or in your present lifestyle for a while and it’s hard to push yourself out of that comfort zone. For now, just ignore the discomfort. Later we’ll deal with your limits, how far you’re willing to venture out of the zone.

Next, turn off your NEGATIVE SELF-TALK. It’s going to want to say things like, “I could learn how to dance. I’ve always wanted to do that. But there’s no way I can become a dancer at my age!” or “I’ve always wanted to learn how to fly a plane. But it must be so hard. I don’t
think I have the time. Plus it must be expensive.” Finding your passion is about taking action
not about listening to that negative little voice in your head that keeps you paralized with fear and doubt. It’s not about practicalities right now. It’s about finding out what your passion is and whether your passion is going to be a part of your job or something you do outside of your work.

Steps to Your Passion
Get a notebook and let's get started!

What would you be willing to do without getting paid?
What can you do for hours without getting bored?
How would you spend your time if money weren’t a problem?
What do you love to talk about when you’re with friends?
Who are you jealous of because of the job they have?
Look back at your life and identify moments when you felt great.  What were you doing? What elements combined to make those moments great?

Have you considered that your passion may be something you haven’t tried yet?  If you’ve lived in your comfort zone for a long time, chances are you haven’t tried new things much. What things have you always wanted to try but haven’t yet?  Painting? Learning a language? Writing a book?

What things have you done that you’re proud of?

Close your eyes and imagine yourself 5 years in the future. What are you doing? What lifestyle are you living?

Time to Do Some Cooking
Now, start combining hard skills, soft skills and the traits mentioned by the people who know you best.

Let’s imagine these are all ingredients and if we combine some of them, we can
bake a cake, if we combine others, we can prepare a salad.  They’re not the same food, but they’re both delicious.  For example, I speak 3 languages + I’m diplomatic + I love to travel = I can be a foreign language teacher abroad. On the other hand, I’m organized + I’m a good writer + I love reading = I can become a freelance editor or copywriter.

As you can see, those are two very different jobs, yet we arrived at both of them combining my different skills.

Steps to Finding the Job You’re OK with
As mentioned before, it may turn out that your passion is not your job and that's fine. That's true for most of us. But it's important to find work that doesn't make you miserable. So let's go back to the notebook!

List the jobs you definitely do not want to do or would even consider.

Make a list of your HARD skills. These are measurable abilities, school learned abilities such as writing, reading, math, using computer software.

Make a list of your SOFT skills. Traits such as etiquette, diplomacy, communication, listening, getting along with people.

Talk to your friends and family and ask them to (honestly!) describe your personality. Take notes.

What were you good at in school/college (it doesn’t matter if you liked it or not)?
What have you been good at in the jobs you’ve had throughout your life?
What matters to you the most when it comes to a career/job: The salary? The hours?
The work environment? Doing something you excel at?

Your Passion
Be flexible. A study by Stanford psychologists found that most people have the mistaken belief that a passion is something you find easy to do. When people pursued their passion and encountered challenges, they gave up. The researchers further studied mindsets about interests in an experiment where a group of students who identified as “techie” or “artsy” were given two articles to read, one tech related and the other related to the humanities.

Students who had a fixed mindset about their interests were less open to reading an article that was outside their area. Unfortunately, focusing one one area could prevent you from finding your passion, which could happen when you bring different fields together, when you see connections between fields that you might not have thought of before.

A Growth Mindset is More Likely to Lead to Your Passion
In another experiment, researchers showed students an interesting video about the origin
of the universe. Most students were fascinated. Then they were asked to read a
challenging scientific article on the same topic. A lot of students lost their initial
excitement and the ones whose enthusiasm for the topic dropped completely were those
who had a fixed mindset about their interest. People who may be interested in a subject
can change their mind when it becomes too challenging.

“Develop” Instead of “Find”
Researchers concluded that “Developing your Passion” is more appropriate than “Finding
Your Passion,” because development requires commitment, seeing things through even
when they become difficult.

Another path to your passion can be developing valuable skills that will lead to greater
career satisfaction because you’ll be financially stable and more likely to develop a passion
for a field you’ve cultivated deep expertise in. In other words, first establish the lifestyle you
want for yourself and then fit a career around your vision. First get your basic needs taken
care of by creating a plan for your life and part of that plan is the development of your
Passion.

Passion Still Requires Discipline
But no matter which approach you choose to follow, you will never develop your passion if you keep switching directions and following every shiny object that crosses your path.

Even if they have a natural talent, ballet dancers invest years of discipline and hard work on their passion. So do athletes. So do millionaires. And so will YOU.

Now step back and look at the big picture.
Is your passion something you can incorporate into your career/job?

Is it something you will be doing on your personal time, after you do your work at a job that is just FINE; it’s not your passion, but it allows you to live well and pursue your passion? "
4810,Job searching for 10 months and not getting anything?,"Honestly just take pride in whatever you do. If you scrub toilets, have the sparkliest toilets on the block. If you serve burgers, make them delicious and beautiful to see. The problem isn't so much you, or your job.. it's the way you look at it! Negativity seeps through and excuses abound -- if you really wanted to make a change, you'd stop making excuses, improve your attitude, and PROVE you DESERVE a better job than you have... honestly, I wouldn't want you as my secretary : I'd be afraid I'd get sued for saying you look nice or have to do more to get you to complete a task correctly than I could just handle myself... "
4811,"At my current job for 8 months, first job out of college. Recently interviewed for a better company/better job where a family friend works. I will hear their decision at 11AM tomorrow.

I am nervous and have never done this before.","Get them a hallmark card that's usually used for funerals, with like ""my condolences on your loss"" written on it, then say you're the one they're gonna lose.

4820,How were you guys able to land a job in a new career field w/o any experience?,"I went from studying classical music to working in marketing/design but targeted music-related companies. Not sure if you’d consider that a complete industry change. 

I knew my music degree would be useless in any other industry without experience, as evident from the dead silence I received from those companies, so I looked for internships and entry level roles where they actually see a music background as a nice perk. And in those positions, trying to shape them towards the direction I want my career to go (I did a marketing internship but convinced my boss I could design more efficiently and just as good  as our outsourced designer and my role shifted to 80% design). But we’re also a small company so this was possible. 

Now I think I have enough work experience to leave the music industry and am working towards that. *fingers crossed* "

What generally do you want to do with your life?
What do you love to do?

You need to answer this first.

General answers are usually;
I want to be rich.
I want to help the world.
I want to get stoned and play videogames.
I don't know.

This helps determine the direction you want up go.

What do you love to do helps determine the path.

So can you answer these questions? Preferably not in 50 paragraphs.

4825,"Sounds like a joke, but isn't-- Ever since I turned 13 I have had constant gas. To top it off, I have a condition that causes me to have chronic bad breath even if I remove tonsils. I have avoided work due to this. Am I as un-hireable as I feel?",Can't you just chew gum...I go to the bathroom every 30 to 60 minutes to pee and blast farts. 
4826,I got a bachelor’s degree just so I can get paid $11 an hour?,What did you expect when you majored in non-luncrative majors? You really should post in the college sub because more people could learn from this. I’m 25 and back in school and you can bet that I do all of my research. I don’t understand why kids these days don’t know that college isn’t something you put on autopilot like high school. 
4827,The biggest career transition in all of history?,"I think this affects people in different ways. It comes down to Maslow's Hierachy of Needs.

People that need to cover their **basic needs** (physiological and safety needs like food, water, warmth, rest, security and safety) will not be in a position to actively choose a career change (whether they liked their job or not). They just need money to have basic living. They might have been in low income jobs with relatively high expenses or even higher income jobs with relatively high outgoings too. If they have lost their job or business, they go back to basic needs.

People that have their basic needs covered, even when they don't have a job (due to low expenses and outgoings and either savings, financially support from elsewhere or passive income from other investments) may then look to fulfill their **esteem needs (around prestige and accomplishment)**. Some may look at self-actualization (to achieve their potential - this is more about growth and contribution to society - looking for greater meaning and purpose in life).

I suspect that t**he time reflecting during lockdown will switch those people focused on prestige and status more to self-actualisation.** People have realised that fancy things are not as important as they thought they were before. It's not as big a deal anymore to have a business meeting on a video call with your kid in the background - this is more acceptable now but never would have been before. Image and luxuries aren't so important to many on reflection. When we are not in control of things in life, we reflect on the most important things. This happens at the time someone dies in particular, but this time of reflection in confinement for many also has made some reflect on some of the well-documented top regrets of the dying (by Bronnie Ware):

  
 **Top Five Regrets of the Dying**

* I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.
* I wish I hadn't worked so much.
* I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings.
* I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
* I wish that I had let myself be happier.

So I think **people who are in a position to afford it will be looking for a career change if they were unhappy in their job**. And **those that were happy motivated by money or status before may be thinking to contribute more to society and lead more meaningful lives**. So purpose-driven career change will be more prevalent for this group. However in total numbers, this group of people is by far the minority of people.

The majority of people, particularly in the North America and Europe, will be at least in the short term (next 6 months) be looking to keep their jobs. And if they have lost their jobs, they will be struggling with making basic needs, even with government support.

There will be a huge demand for services that enable people to save money. Any startups that create real solutions in this space will do well.

I am interested myself in those that are looking to make a career change now and why. The ones whose basic needs are not being met will only make career changes because they are forced to as entire industries are changing e.g. travel and hospitality will take some time to recover. 

Society and individuals will and have become more resourceful and flexible as a result of this crisis (through necessity), so I think there will be some great startups emerging from this and also people just hustling to make ends meet as there won't be jobs for them for a while.

Who here is looking to make a career change and wants to do something more purposeful now? "

4830,How do you go about applying for a job in a different state before you move there?,"I relocated from WA to AZ last summer and ended up with multiple job offers before I moved. Because I wanted to be sure I could easily find work, I looked in my current field (Education) that I have years of experience in and is in high demand. That made the process a lot easier. 

I just explained the situation when asked to interview and offered to do it via Skype or phone call instead and everyone I spoke to was very flexible. 

I think if you are a desirable enough candidate, employers are going to be more accommodating to try and hire you. Good luck! "

4834,So What SHOULD Candidates Say On Interviews?,[deleted] 
4835,Can i really get a job if i complete a few courses in data science through udemy/coursera etc without having a bachelors degree?,"I’m not an IT person, but usually, the hiring process is surprisingly subjective. It’s always flexible, and the more like able you can be in an interview, the better chance you have. 

If you can demonstrate appropriate skills for the job, or that you can *learn* the appropriate skills fast enough, or that they like you, or that you’re a great company fit and they need *anyone* ASAP- there are all just examples. 

But you’ll never be given that chance if they don’t know you exist.

I always recommend “hacking” the application process by not only submitting their standard form of applying, but trying to make a connect on LinkedIn, trying to meet someone from the company in person (not by stalking, but at a career fair, or maybe if they host an event) or getting creative in that sense. If you can get in front of them with creativity, they usually respect that a lot and remember you. "
4836,"Selected after only one interview, and I was told I was their first candidate?",Everyone else asked for more money and wasn't available immediately 
4837,What careers could I pursue having lost my only job of 10 years due to deterioration in health?,"Lithographic Printing is probably one of the least physically demanding jobs on Earth, if you find that too hard, then im afraid youre going to struggle to find options. I would suggest bus or taxi driving if the eyesightight isnt going to be a problem. "
4838,I am riddled with anxiety every day because I’m scared of getting fired again. What do I do?,"Talk to your boss about this. 

Not to say ""please don't fire me"" but you say ""I'm hugely motivated to do whatever I need to be indispensable to you. I want to be completely sure that I'm focused on what you want me focused on, and that you see me as a valuable resource for achieving your goals.""

Talk to your boss. ""I can be whatever you want me to be. If I'm not a good fit for you, and you'd prefer someone more X or Y just tell me and I'll become that.""

Basically, be coachable. "
4839,I have absolutely no passion for any field. How can I find career for myself?,"What about getting a nursing degree.  I had a friend who was feeling the same exact way, but with a chemistry degree he hated.  Eventually, he went into nursing school and adored it. "
4840,Furloughed for 3 months then fired for performance issues. What to do next?,"Get in touch with an employment lawyer. The company cannot fire with cause that easily, and would need to have documented meetings about low performance for a period of time to do so. Since they 99% most likely did not, they owe you severance pay of about a month per year worked (at least in Ontario, the lawyers will be able to tell you what you are i’m entitled to where you live). You can also have them pay your lawyer fees. Don’t let these fucks dick you around. "
4841,Have you ever used LinkedIn profile updates to passively signal you your employer/manager that you may be looking?,"No, in my experience, it was useless. And a lot of people was hitting on me via dm. 

Also the applications are also pointless, the employer's HR doesn't look on them. "

Other institutions may have something similar, but cheaper. "
4850,"A recruiter lectured me regarding my handling of my interview, and then extended an offer; should I still accept?","It is a bit weird, yes, but I think it is kind of them to give you some feedback on something they think is important to their business. You call it a lecture and maybe it was but from their point of view it could be constructive criticism. I personally like the honesty. And since they offered you the job and simultaneously offering some criticism, I consider this a good sign, that they are communicative and want to work with you, even on what they could consider as a weakness of yours. To sum up, I wouldn't let that ""lecture"" stand in the way of my job decision. "
4851,Can you ever be satisfied in a job if you’re not very career driven?,"I think what might work is to find a job with the work/life balance you want so it doesn’t feel like work is taking over your life. That way you can have time for hobbies or just enjoying life! Also, having a job that you can clock out and forget about is great rather than having a job where your work follows you home. 

My job pays my bills and lets me have a large amount of scheduled days off. When I’m not at work I totally block it out of my mind! I don’t hate my career but it’s not my passion. I don’t think you need to love your job to be happyin life. "

I'm dead. Hilarious. I have the same problem. In retrospect, after having tried traveling, and after having wound up addicted to drugs and alcohol, I can totally say that this nation is in liberal compassion crisis. A large majority of our generation isn't functionally independent, we're indoctrinated by group think, socialism, and all the universities are propaganda wagons of the left wing. I took a job traveling, and it was hell on my psyche and my wallet. I only saved 5k that year. That's when I realized that my dreams will take sacrifice, commitment, and responsibility. "
4854,How do I craft a resume to avoid age/sex-discrimination ?,"Maybe consider that you're just no longer benefiting from sex discrimination?

4858,Is the grass always greener?,"Lots of good comments here, I totally relate to your feelings. I’ve been deep in corporate life for 3 years and it’s hard to get away from the stress.

I’ve decided that I’ll like to take control of my life eventually so I’ve decided to make moves towards opening up my own business. Doing this after work helps me keep my eye on the prize and realize this work role is temporary "

4862,Why you shouldn't spend too much time worrying about your career?,"Although some things fall to luck and randomness, a degree of planning helps and oftentimes your ""gut"" is wrong especially on career choices. And life doesn't always ""work out in the end"", it can get very fucked up if you make mistakes. But ultimately I think life is about the willingness of a man to get back up when knocked down, no matter how many times. "
4863,Stable job I like ($50k) or risky job I love ($70k)?,I believe companies pull credit and can use a low score to deny you a job. 500 May be to low. Unless you don’t tell your current employer until after all background checks are complete.

I got a job in an entirely new field and quit 3 weeks in because... reasons... but mental health was a big piece for me.

4867,A former employee of mine is represented herself on her resume using my title and not the title she had. Should I let her current employer know this or let it slide?,"I've been thinking this over and considering the discrimination women face in the job market and in getting promotions, it seems to me she leveled an unfair playing field a little for herself. Men with any color of skin are favored over women when applying for jobs and when promotions are being handed out.

And now here comes a man thinking about knocking her back into her low place. I notice that you must think she is qualified for the job because that wasnxt  brought up just that she cheated  no doubt after being cheated time an again by an unfair system. Let her have the success this one time man.

She has  a life maybe even kids to support. You'd know, since she worked with you. Look at it as your turn to do right by a woman on behalf of all the women who have been wronged. "
4868,Stuck in a job that's ruining my health & job search is hopeless. What do I do now?,"Complaining and dwelling only makes you more stuck. Take control of your life. Stop complaining and do the work to make the change. Nothing will be given to you in life. You are not entitled to happiness but only the pursuit of it. Change your thoughts about your situation and then change your situation. You're young, educated and motivated. You are the only thing holding you back. "

4874,"When a company calls you to say you did not get the job, and then adds, ""It was down to you and one other person."" How often is that actually true?","In my experience on the recruiting and hiring side, it’s always been true, and contact was made out of respect and the hope that maybe we have something for them/you in the future. "
4875,How do you figure out what you want to do with your life?,"Probably not a popular answer, but unless you are super passionate about something, your job is secondary to your real contentment in life.  What worked for me was going abroad for a while.  I spent two years teaching English in Asia. It gave me a lot of time to think, as well as meet people from a completely different culture and see how they deal with this question.

It seems to me the most successful and widely used strategy is to find something you don’t completely hate doing that earns money and has decent benefits, then use your money for the things you actually like, such as caring for your loved ones and pursuing hobbies, and set aside a little bit for old age.  That seems to be the general strategy of the happier older people I’ve met.  Good luck. "

The basic coding course might be a nice idea. You must be proactive and positive. Have you called Union Pacific to see if there are any current vacancies or not? What about a move to a new city? That might boost your employment chances significantly as well. 

Good luck and let us know what happens next! Do you have a resume? Have a look at the company website, often you can find relevant information such as the job descriptions on there. 

P.S congratulations on your first child. "
4879,Had a serious panic attack at work. Is this a good time to jump off?,"If your job is making you this miserable, it’s not worth it. At all. You have some savings - you can take a short-term placeholder job for now while you search for something in your field again. If you’ve already had a panic attack once, chances are it could happen again. "
4880,"I'm 21, and I'm making the best money I've ever made... but I don't think I want to do this job forever. What are my options?","holy shit, you actually have a job??? "
4881,How does one find work they enjoy?,"find out what you’re good at and run with it. I always imagined myself being in the biology field but after a short time there I realized I hated it, even though it’s what I always thought I wanted. So after I got over that I realized that I was always good with numbers, became a calc teacher for a brief stint then went on to become a pilot. Both much better than biology IMO "
4882,I recently quit my job in an attempt to reinvent myself but all job offers are related to the industry I left (logistics) which I honestly grew to despise . How can I finally leave it behind?!,"Hi probably every role and industry is transferable.  I transferred from science to IT and am much happier.  IT is much more rewarding and I'm able to fully utilize a broad skillset.  So you need to figure out what your skills actually are.  But one thing I would say is you really need to figure out your finances, healthcare etc.  You may actually want to move to Europe or something that is not the US.  

Also if you have a BS i would not say going back to a 4 year or masters is the best thing because masters are pretty expensive.  I went to a committee college for 2 years and that worked out well although it was too easy given my education (if i could have gotten it done in 1 semester I would have).

If it were me though, knowing what I know now, i'd get back into your field with an actual exit plan, instead of just quitting and hoping something strikes you.  You need funds and indicating that you only have 4-5 months of emergency funds, given no kids or mortgage, means you didn't save nearly enough for a career transition.  It took me about 3 years to go back to my old salary, which was only 40k, and it took 5 years to get above that.   I was able to do it because my wife provided insurance and a livable salary, and we had no kids at the time. "

4886,In a unique position with my current job where I realistically will only work one week every month. What are some other jobs/sources of income I can do with the other three weeks?,"If you're not hurting for money, you may look towards career certifications and courses; stuff like First Aid and CPR courses.

4892,Is it common for hr to give job seekers false hope?,"Generally speaking, HR recruiters are there to serve as a conduit between the hiring decision makers and the candidates. This generally means they act friendly and want you to succeed, and most cases this is true because it reflects positively on their work. A lot of decision making is out of their hands. "
4893,How do I accept that I have to work the rest of my life?,"I wasn’t able to enjoy myself until I fully understood why the world is the way it is. Namely, why must I spend so much time working and so little time exploring myself and this world? I encourage you to read more philosophy and history. Personally I found that Marxism and Leftism explains history very well and why we are slaves to our jobs. Through learning about this, I have found that my life outside of work has transformed into a true meaningful journey of self growth and personal connection. My bus ride to and from work is reading leftist literature, my weekends are spent doing activism and performing music with progressive ideals. My job sucks but my life is rich, my outside hours filled with energy

You are right to be questioning how to enjoy life outside of work because that’s where real life is. The key is learning, growth, truth and connecting with others via that truth "

4895,What can an introvert do to feel comfortable socialising in a corporate work environment?,"As an introvert, why are you trying to fit in? Work is work. Not to make friends. “Getting along” comes natural. You’ll bond with those that click “naturally”

Be yourself. Don’t become pressured. Especially smoking. Please. Focus on your work. And you’ll click just fine. And if you don’t, leave! You don’t want to work there. Unless it about survival.

Not the best answer, but I’m also in the process too. Learned a lot along the ways. Continuing to learn. Especially being an introvert.

When I go out in the field with my coworkers, they are surprised how social I am. I’m just introverted at work. I focus on my work & avoid small talk. But naturally, you’ll learn to build on those talks by the environment you’re in. You’ll adapt "
4896,"How should you act if you have a lot of experience at a job, but are treated as a newbie?",Go to your supervisor and ask for a sit down. Explain that you are very versed in this work already and ask for an expedited/modified training plan. Try getting into the work itself but don’t be afraid to tuck your tail when you need to ask questions. Be careful about trying to “show off” because that’s how you’ll get fired.

4900,How do you deal with performance reviews and goal setting when you no longer care about your job?,"Sounds like you and your line manager are in kind of the same boat. What are their business performance goals? Take them, say ""my goal is to help you achieve your goal, and here's how,"" and boom! One goal down. 


Acknowledge the elephant in the room - culture shift. Maybe a second goal can be about how you'll embrace these new colleagues and help them learn the ropes. Doesn't have to be true, but you don't want to alienate everyone just yet. Also you need to BS a goal here. 


Third, what about personal development? Think of your next job, and a skill that you'd need on the job there that you have yet to possess/perfect. There's your personal goal, and when you're working on it, you're taking time at your current job preparing you to be more successful at your next one. Win win. "

And I was never underweight, but I know what it's like to buck the fuck up and gain some muscle. And I'm sorry you think I give a fuck if someone is anorexic or has genetic problems. I lack empathy for weak people. And if you think that's ignorance, boy, you gonna get bullied by others. And my words have nothing to do with engineer material, my skills do.” ~ Harley Jades "
4903,Does anyone have experience with never being satisfied with jobs?,"I feel a lot of this in my soul. I wish I had some advice for you but I am in the same boat. I lend more on the side if I fucking hate my job, every job I’ve ever had, and dread waking up in the morning because it means another day of work. At this point I am convinced I can’t and will never be fulfilled by my job unless it is my own business.
I constantly fantasize about starting my own business just like you said, but I never have any money to get it started which leads to an endless feedback cycle of being miserable. I can’t make enough money to start my business and I’m 100% miserable trying to save up enough through work and they both compound and make me feel like such a worthless loser. 
Best of luck to you. I hope you find what you are looking for. "
4904,When should I tell my boss my wife is pregnant after starting a new job?,"your math is off man... 

3 months pregnant and due in July is a total of 7 months more time for July 1, which puts 10 months total, not the 38 weeks general fert time. 

go with weeks when measuring, it will make your wife happier, and get it to a real time frame for ya. 

you are also not required to inform your boss until mere weeks before the due date. i encourage people to go with 3 months before due date to allow planning. but i also take a month when my kids are born so...

No more mistakes!"" 

This was a wake up call for me, I guess multi tasking is only effective to some extent but when you work with the upper management everything must be accurate and if you multi task a lot there is high chance of making a mistake.

4911,Am I too old to find a work at home job?,"I am in a VERY Similar situation and would like to share my 2 cents

&#x200B;

1. Please keep filling apps on indeed and walking into local places for apps, and then quit this job. Nomatter what you do, it will be different, probably pay more, and have less hours.
2. It's never too late to seek a medical diagnosis for your introvertedness. It is likely a symptom of something greater like AVPD, CPTSD, or autism spectrum related. in fact, if you're an introvert in your 50's, and it is interfering with your career, there is an undeniably strong chance of it . I just recently read a post of a 58 y/o newly diagnosed man. I think this would be helpful to you to receive needed help. You are not helping yourself nor your mom by avoiding diagnosis and torturing yourself.
3. Also, this may be hard to hear, but: Your mom, inspite of her best intentions, did not properly prepare you for a successful life. Instead of encouraging you and genuinely pushing and helping you every day to go out and date and get married and have a family of your own, she may have inadvertently stunted your social and emotional growth. Who is going to be there for you when she gets older and passes? What children will look after your wellbeing, if you got none? Been there done that. Please look for a good therapist.. shop around ifyou have to... make sure it's a male therapist.

good luck, brother. "

Maybe life isn't everything you want right now, but look at all the awesome stuff you've done. I'm sorry you regret your degree, and to be blunt, you are right, it probably won't be that helpful on the job market. That is the risk of being an artist. But it was the choice you made at the time. 

Make peace with it. You got to spend time focusing on something you enjoyed, and now you are in a new stage in life with different values. Wishing you had those same values (i.e - financial security) YEARS ago isn't all that fair to your past self. You did what seemed good at the time. 

Something you could try to do is informational interviews. This is when you reach out to a professional and meet with them, not to interview for a job, but simply to learn more about their organization, and what they do. Maybe there is even someone at your current software company you could have coffee with a learn a bit more about their job, how they got there, what experiences they've had in the past, what degrees they have, etc. 

You can also reach out to other companies. I know of someone who did informational interviews with professionals from over a dozen Human Resources firms, which eventually led to her finding her top two or three HR firms she wanted to work for, so she eventually applied and got a job with one. 

More school is always an option, but take your time exploring. You might consider a master's degree, you might consider trade school or a medical technology program. Lots of options out there.

You don't need to find the perfect job or feel like it's your whole purpose in life. Chances are, nothing will feel quite like that. But hopefully you can explore your options and find something worth while for you. Good luck. "
4915,"Considering taking a 20k pay cut for quality of life improvement. Am I insane? 27yo male, married, looking 85k to 65k.","So there are a few elements to this that you will need to consider. 

1) Your professional career
2) Your personal life
3) Future clash of those things.

You say your wife is dissatisfied now. Even though you're bringing in $85K a year (which is no small feat), have created a strong budget and are effectively setting yourself up for vast future success. 

What's to say she won't be dissatisfied with your performance as a husband when you take the pay cut? Sure, you're around more often, but you're worth less money. She's eventually going to want a bigger house for the kids, a few nice vacations, and ongoing placation beyond that.

Are you willing to chase down another person's happiness in lieu of chasing your own dreams? 

Sounds like you could really start making huge bucks within the next 4-5 years if you stick with your current trajectory. For a vast majority of upper middle class breadwinners, the 20s are when you slog and grind hard af so that you can see copious success through your 30s and 40s without the same impact on personal life that you had in your 20s.

Think strongly about what you're chasing here. I wouldn't let another person get between me and my mission for success. "

4924,Careers that aren’t boring?,"College will not teach you anything relevant. If it’s able to be written down in a textbook and taught in a classroom then the information is already irrelevant. Your supposed to teach yourself valuable skills on your own time. With that said college is just an expensive way to get networking opportunities to get your foot in the door into a certain competitive industry and is still worth the return on investment if your pick the right industry. 

As for what you would find interesting? That’s completely subjective. A lot of people and myself really didn’t find out what fields interested us until in college. It took us poking our heads in the door at different jobs and figuring out what they actually did to determine what interests us because it’s hard to give yourself a good impression on what interests you from the outside. It pretty took a bit of shadowing, asking older people I know what they did on their day to day, mentoring and checking career pages on places like reddit where you can get real unfiltered feedback on a job. "
4925,"How can I manage-up a raging micromanager who lacks manners? Specifically, how can I address a 4-hr drive with him?","Most companies do not allow people to use their personal cars for company business. Nor should you want to. If an accident occurs it causes huge confusion for liability. Under no circumstances should you permit your personal car to be used to drive your boss home from the meeting. You must put your foot down. It has nothing to do with your manager’s behavior; it is a huge potential liability for you. Your auto insurance might actually cancel your policy if they find out you used your car for business purposes. Do. Not. Do. It.

If the company needs you to travel for business, they get to pay for it. Why do you have to drive while the boss gets to take the train? Inform your company that if they need you there, they will buy you a ticket. If they balk, then your response needs to be “well, I guess my attendance isn’t that important, is it?“

I know this sounds snarky and impertinent, but it sounds like your company is taking advantage of you, and you need to put a stop to it immediately before it has a significant adverse effect on your personal life. "

If its just the scheduling that really gets to you then maybe sticking in Hospitality is a great path. It's probably your best bet of moving out of what you're doing without a pay cut.

Working in a museum sounds great but as you said, you might need to go back to school which needs to be paid for an that work can be hard to find especially if you're not interested in moving to where the work is. 

&#x200B;

Finally there's IT and without obvious experience you'll need something that shows you know what you're talking about.   
And unless you get lucky or really work on the education part for a network or sysadmin role you might need to break in via a helpdesk role. Which is fine but it might mean a paycut in the interim. "
4946,Managers - How To Keep an Outstanding Employee?,"i will start by saying money comes before work only in the dictionary.  People rarely are paid for their potential.. being willing to learn and a go-getter doesnt sound like she is actively doing more yet.  If you were coming to me as a boss with that, I'd probably say no too.

if she doing more though...there is lots you can bring up.

I keep seeing responses about costs to replace her vs paying more.  That's a terrible reason to pay someone more.  Don't do this.  It sounds like you are 
trying to avoid a burden more than get her what is deserved. 

First and foremost, do a market survey of typical compensation for someone with her education, skills, experience and salary.  Where does she measure up? if she is truly underpaid, that will be apparent in your research and you can use this.  Market value is where salaries should start and go up from there.

What does her evaluation show as contributions to achieving the goals of the company.  try to quantify how much more than expected was saved or earned because of *her* filling that position.. and that it wouldn't likely have been that way without her.

explain why professionally *you* need her. give examples as to how she helps you focus less on tasks that otherwise would get in the way of taking care of what your boss is really relying on you for.  without her reliably taking them off your radar, your productivity is going to be affected.

Bottom line is people generally stick around mainly because of loyalty, lack of options, money, job satisfaction, opportunities to advance, or geographics.  you should contemplate why would she stay?  if she's already considering leaving.. would money be enough and for how long?   "
4947,Unhappy in a new job. Is it an awful move to resign after two weeks?,"Nothing wrong in leaving a job that you are not happy at.

4948,Thinking of quitting dream job because of toxic managers; can't win for losing. Any advice or insight?,"Sounds hard. I identify with a lot of this. Pretty typical Asian management, actually. You are not really going to find anything different than this in Asia. It's the main reason why Japanese women (mainly) want to leave Japan so often. I've lived in Taiwan for the last 12 years, I'm male, and this is exactly how every job I've had here is. My advice is to stick it out and just understand this is the work culture in Asia. It's not nice or good, but it is what it is. They will flat out make up negative stuff about you. I've had it happen to me for years. The negative things they make up are often very similar to the problem the administrator has, as you wrote. Just this last year one of my bosses said he was worried I am becoming negative. He made it up completely. Made up a whole story that myself and a coworker got in an argument. That coworker and I laughed so hard together about that. Anyways, the administrator is one of the most negative people you'll ever meet. Hilarious he said I was becoming negative. I take all this with humor. I still get my raises every year (recently quit, actually, but unrelated).  Just try to remember that Asian cultures don't give a lot of praise, but instead criticize and complain a lot, and people above you at work will shit talk you all day. It's not you; it's them. If it was you, they'd fire you. About people ignoring you, also very normal. Reason being is if you can get in on the ""hate train"" the more likely it won't be directed at you. Pretty awful. Stealing ideas is also normal. There are many TV shows on Asian TV depicting this. "

This way, you won’t have so much hanging on one interview. This makes it easier to cut losses and carry on instead of dwelling on the things you did wrong in the interview. If it works for you, your relaxed state in the will only benefit your job search and make you look great under pressure!

I found if you pre-processed a letdown, you have nothing to be anxious about. Future you will thank you!

They ask vague questions and are notorious for oddball inaccurate results.  We do a very poor job of knowing our own strength, weakness, and interests. Frankly, when we are young we do a poor job of knowing ourselves at all.  That's partly of why these tests are so ineffective.

Unfortunately, trying to figure out what you want to do for work by taking a test is a good way to find yourself pursuing a career with out knowing why you're doing it.  People who find careers they're passionate about most often stumble upon them unexpectedly.  

Therefore, the best practice would be to try a bunch of careers out via internship, volunteering, and shadowing to see what you enjoy.

Good Luck. "
4963,"Never worked, in my 40s, what do I do? Please help, any advice is welcome.","Do not go to college. White collar jobs are basically off the table for you. Sorry but no one would hire you and you would waste time and money.

Opt1: Take 1-2 years to go travel to see the world. Try to make some income while traveling.

Opt2: College is scam imo. But here to network and choose a degree wisely. Try to get some work experience before graduation.

Opt3: learn a trade for 2 years. Add additional certifications to rank up fast.

4969,Would I be stupid to leave my first job out of college after only two months?,"You'd only be stupid if you left this job *before* you had another one.

Or if you didn't renegotiate your salary *after* you started getting interviews.

Here's what I would do:

1. Apply to jobs until you get a better paying one. Don't accept yet, say you have to talk to your employer to make sure you can leave within 2 weeks, ""You don't want to burn any bridges"", all that jazz.

2. Go back to your original employer. Tell them that you would like a 50% (or more, has to be more than the other job you got) pay increase, plus 'time and a half' overtime, because the company lied about several things, including working 18 days straight. You also would like the company to pay for any and all travel related expenses, including personal costs. I'm not sure what type of job it is, but maybe, just maybe, they *actually* need you and are willing to pay more.

3. Here's the fun part. If they agree, you can take the job but as long as it's more than the other new job. Or, you can balk and quit because they were being disrespectful by paying so low in the first place. Or, you can try and renegotiate *again* to get something else, like a $10k bonus to cover the previous time when you were underpaid.

Edit: how did this go from being upvoted to being downvoted?? I guess companies don't like it when their employees negotiate... "

4972,I like learning about complex things but not necessarily implementing/creating complex things. Job prospects for me?,"If you can't do, then go teach. "
4973,What's the reasoning behind paying new hires significantly more than current employees?,"I think it ultimately comes down to statistics. They want to spend the least possible on payroll. When they figure out how big (or not) raises need to be, they look at overall data. If they give a 10% raise, most people will probably not want to leave, but payroll just went up 10%. If they give a 0% raise, then payroll doesn't go up, but they are going to have to replace people.

But what if it is in between? Statistically, if they give a 0.5% raise and assume they need to replace 50 people, then they will need to pay 50 new people their full market rate, not to mention recruiting costs and the lost productivity. If they run the numbers again at 2%, then they might have to replace 1 or 2 people at full market rate, but that ends up being a lot cheaper overall than giving *everybody* a higher raise.

That's why it pays to be the employee that leaves for better pay. They know full well that the ones that stay are being paid below what they are worth, and they will continue to pay them below what they are worth as long as they think that enough of them will just take it, complain, but show up on Monday anyway.

Also, don't burn out. Keep your work/life balance.

4983,How to stay calm and separate work anxiety from my personal life?,"I user to work 100h weeks, i still do, but i uses to too. Here is my trick. Thankfully they are much less frequent now.

1) When I'm at work I'm 110% committed to do what needs to be done, and I god damn do it WITHIN WORKING HOURS. I don't mind coming at 7am and leaving a 8pm if that's whats needed to meet the deadlines. But once I left my desk, unless its a life or death situation, I'm not answering emails, I'm not answering texts. Remember, you're not in the business of saving babies or rescuing old ladies, it can wait till tomorrow! 

My off time is mine. Learn to put boundaries or else you will spend 8 months trying to get back on your feet again after you burn out. I survived my burn out and I hope you don't get to experience what I have been through. Never again. 

2) My second lesson is learn to delegate. If you can't do it on your own, bitch about it until they give you someone to help you out or give that task to someone else. It might sound desperate or at times unprofessional, but your health comes first. Never forget that. 

3) Nobody ever regrets not spending more time at the office while on their death bed. Just sayin'. So chill, smell the flower, and adopt a more stoic mindset. "
4984,I got a job after being asked not to apply - how to handle pissy coworker? (XP on AITA),"This might better suited for r/relationships.

Were you two ever romantically involved? This sounds like a reaction to a bad break up or failed attempt at a romantic relationship (nice guy / nice girl - esque). 

Edit: I just noticed you are also a female. She could simply be a jealous neighbor. Not sure why she is zinging you with the “embarrassed to be fired” comments. Definitely a maturity issue here. "
4985,Company called(?) to reject me and told me I’d be considered for other jobs?,"1. Email was probably automatically generated or could be company policy that every candidate gets a rejection email if they don't get the job.

2. Phone call was probably a courtesy considering they asked you to come in same day for an interview.

3. They may have liked you as a candidate but went with the other candidate for whatever reason (experience, connections, internal candidate, etc.)

4. Don't overthink this situation. It could literally be a million different things that are out of your control. It sounds like you responded professionally already so *if you really want a job there* keep that relationship professional. "

4998,What happens if you leave work before attending your own termination meeting?,"I did this. Years ago I was a sysadmin at a little company that got acquired by a large video game company that you've heard of. Eventually I got a new boss. We did not get along, my productivity went through the floor, and one morning a friend in operations texted me saying ""hey man, sorry about the news."" I said ""what news?"" and he told me there was a request to disable my computer access because boss was going to fire me. This followed a couple of months of deteriorating conditions on the job, and on this day I had actually gone in early to talk to him about how things were going. [Twilight Zone theme]

I had already received a meeting request that morning from boss for like 10am so I was already thinking in terms of how the next few hours should go. After he went back to hold his 9am daily meeting, I gathered up all my stuff and walked out the front door. A few hours later I got a voicemail from him saying ""You missed a meeting, so I'm going to have to let you go."" Great reasoning, of course, but I was already done with him, so him giving a weak reason came as no surprise. I was relieved for the first time in a long time. AFAIK he still doesn't know what happened.

In the long run nothing happened as a result, save professional repercussions, and that a few years later I got notice of an Unclaimed Property from them waiting for me at the state. I applied for it and when I got it, it was about the amount of a last check.
  
Another kinda bad part was that I had bought an expensive car literally the day before all this. I still have it, but it was the most TV thing to have happened through all this. womp womp. Another bad part is that I didn't stay in touch with the guy who tipped me off. We got along really well (rare for me in a huge company) and we should have stayed friends, and all in all I did generally screw myself in terms of references. My bad. "

Now the rest of the whites know to respect me.  I suggest you do the same. "
5001,I don't feel like I am intelligent enough for my job should I leave for an easier job?,"Stop being a pussy.  

Now that it's out of the way, let's get to the content of your post.  If you're working for a boss who says yours was the only normal resume, you didn't have much competition for that job.  If she told you that, she probably lacks much managerial experience anyway.
Second, you clearly have the outward EQ required to get that and other jobs which is a huge asset for you.  Embrace it. 
Third, fake it until you make it gets a bad reputation because it's taken too literally.  Learn to see your job as an opportunity to get paid to learn and prove to them and (more importantly) yourself that you can evolve.  It's empowering once you figure that out. 
Fourth, don't ever return to that bar.  That bartender doesn't deserve your business.  If you have to tell everybody you're smarter, you're the sucker.

5010,How to handle rude coworker?,"Both suggestions given are solid. I personally would make a joke of her behavior and mock her right back to her face. When I’m over a peer’s behavior I typically mimic it in a slightly exaggerated fashion and call out key points while doing so. For example: “ seems like someone can’t handle feedback just like they can’t handle stress or even the project”. I wish knew more specifics so I can help with the rebuttals.

Side note I typically make light of things with a little joke so others don’t feel attacked. Younger peer I have seem to be extra touchie as a whole so a little joking can help them eat the feedback sandwich. It’s takes a lot of tact but super satisfying. "

No one can ask you to predict the future, so anyone who asks you to is really just telling you what they want out of you. That's the bargain now - a year of work (in his interests) for your promotion. Is that worth it to you right now?

I'd wager that yes, it is. When it comes down to the time you were going to move, there's going to be more that goes into it than saying it, so you've got plenty of time to plan out those details. You may find that something comes up and makes you delay anyway. "

5046,Just don't understand how to get INTO a career?,This is exactly why i dropped out of college and now pursuing a trade. You end up getting your self a useless 4 year degree and cant find a career meanwhile your in debt. Shoulda studied something useful man. Best of luck 
5047,"Recruiters, what does it mean when you ask - ""Are you currently pursuing any other jobs/opportunities?""","We really want to know if you are actively looking searching for new role or where you are in the job market. So if you are, i think it is good to be transparent. "
5048,Can you ask for a raise if your rent is going up?,"Dittoing all the 'yes but not with that phrasing' however, also look into your local laws. 

There's often limits on rent increases, and if its over a certain percent or amount you may be able to get your landlord to make it a much smaller increase.

I know a few buildings here 'accidentally' miss-type $150 instead of $15 the first increase to see if people know our city has a cap on increasing the rent. "
5049,"The career that I've studied, worked, loved and committed myself to has changed so much over the last ten years that I don't like it anymore. What do I do now?",Maybe it isn't the entire industry that's changed. Perhaps it's about finding another company with great people whom you have chemistry with? 
5050,Could I reasonably learn enough Excel to pass a skills assessment over one weekend?,"yes, but it will take every waking hour. "
5051,Just landed a job earning $140k/year. I don't have a college degree. Should I go back to school and finish?,Get your degree... Why be stuck with less options?  
5052,What in the world can I do with two LibArts degrees besides burn them for warmth?,"Totally sympathize - I also have two degrees in what I like to call SOFT SCIENCES of communications ... also graduated at the pit of the fall 2008. I wound up in global mobility as a business development manager and make 100k a year. They’re super flexible with your location usually and provide a lot of time to travel and meet new people. It isn’t what I dreamed I’d be doing but it works and it pays the bills. 

To incorporate my degree, I write industry articles and I help write RFPs and sales presentations as well as the training guides for new hires. 

I also teach English as a second language on the side, so I get my fix of grammar . 

 "
5053,How the hell am I meant to get a job after graduation if employers all want 3+ years of experience and tonnes of certificates??,"I'm job searching in the Netherlands. A lot of ""junior"" positions require 0-2 years experience. No more.  "
5054,I'm 22 and I'm stuck. What can I do?,Are you involved in a faith community?  Would you be open to that? 
5055,Is it worth going back to school for a completely different career path?,College isn’t for everyone either. Don’t waste your money on college if you do not know what you want to do. You could end up with a lot of debt and a useless degree. Warren Buffet never went to college. People in trade unions make 60 to 100 k a year with no college and they want women to join badly. 
5056,My nephew is 20 and worked 2 years as a cashier at walmart. He wants to be a bank teller or transition to customer service. Is his experience relevant for this positions?,Why? Those jobs are going to get taken over soon by AI. Tellers will be one of the first 
5057,Feeling overwhelmed at work and actually broke down in public today - What should I do?,"Get out! Look for a role with a smaller company or better team starting tomorrow. You can't learn in an environment like that, and as a starting employee, part of your job is to learn and build confidence. Sure -- some places are like that. I've worked for both big tech companies and agencies. Some teams are, but many are don't have those issues to that extreme. 

Of course, don't quit until you have an offer. But start putting your name out there. Take phone interviews in your car. Have a ""doctor's appointment"" for in-person interviews. Shop your resume around and ask about the company culture and overtime in your interview. Definitely read Glassdoor reviews too.  "

5059,Boss asked me pour/serve him water - is this appropriate in a professional workplace?,"There was a post a month or two ago that sounds VERY similar to this.  Either it's just a coincidence, or you're reposting for karma. "
5060,How can I stop worrying over future workplaces and mean colleagues?,"Don't forget to have fun being petty. Find ways to screw them over. Carry around a small bottle of fast-drying industrial-strength glue. Did they just walk away from their desk and leave their keys there? Glue one down and then find a way to delay them getting back to their desk so the glue has a chance to dry.

Bring fart spray to work. When they walk away from their desk, put it very close to their seat and chair back and then spray to your heart's content without getting caught. When they get back and sit down, they now have fart stink attached to them the rest of the day. Even just throwing a little water on their seat can ruin their day. "
5061,Should I let go of work ethics ?,"Your coworkers are playing the system to get out of the rat race. To them, you're the fool. "
5062,Should I Accept Job Offer Even Though it is VERY Bad Timing?,I would tell the recruiter that u need to like stay until your company gets better I dunno if that’s a bad idea or not but I am only 19 soo yeaaaa 
5063,How do you find a job when you have no job?,"I’m a hiring manager for a media/advertising company in Toronto — about half my life these days is going through resumes and interviewing people - the company is staffing up and my team is getting quite big...

Anyway - just wanted to say it’s really not a prerequisite or even necessary to have a job to get a job — these days it’s very normal to see people who have been laid off or who are looking. Though I’d urge you to have talking points and good reasons around WHY you’re looking and why you’re currently not working. You will definitely be asked about it. 

Good luck and keep at it. "
5064,How do you approach finding a job at the age of 50 with an 11 year unemployment gap?,"She could potentially get some money for taking care of her elderly mother.You can read about the eligibility here (this was updated May 2018 so I don't know if its current)

[https://www.payingforseniorcare.com/paid-caregiver/elderly-parents.html](https://www.payingforseniorcare.com/paid-caregiver/elderly-parents.html)

Caregiving is something she can go into beyond that, too.

She can also be things like a school lunch mom or monitor at school.  Hotels generally are always hiring and she could be a housekeeper. Retail and customer service also always have openings, may not pay a lot but it's something.

Don't put it as an employment gap. I think a lot of people in the comments are being negative, but she should just put in at home elderly care for her mother.  There are also a lot of people who go back to work after raising kids and things like that so people should stop thinking that this world is that cruel to older people.

If she is computer savvy-then there are also online jobs. "
5065,I get paid to do nothing. Should i stay at my job?,Make a blog

5068,Should I leave a toxic work environment after only 3 months of working there? I was previously unemployed for 8 months prior to taking this job.,"No toxic environment is worth staying in. I worked in one a couple years ago. A senior team member treated everyone like shit and he had the manager by the balls for some reason, so the manager never did anything about the endless complaints from all of us. I was able to make it a little more tolerable about three months in when we did our shift rotation, but it also caused new problems because of the hours. "
5069,"My degree is useless, I can't get far in my job and I'm scared to pursue my passions. What do I do next?","Cake baker/decorator. **I love making and decorating cakes**. I make a good sponge but my decorating still needs work. It's fun but I'm scared of messing up especially when someone paid for my services. On a related note opening a cafe has been considered too. *It sounds like you hate your job. I do not see anything positive about what you described.*

This sounds awesome!  Have you considered transitioning into this? I mean by investing more time into this. Simply without any business plan you are guaranteed to set yourself up for failure. I see a lot of poor implementation of great ideas. Did you know that there are places, in the US, that you can rent out kitchens with professional cooking tools? Are there any near where you live?

* Look to other bakeries to see what they're doing - maybe you'll learn something
   * See if they are hiring -- this is hands on experience that could expand your skills beyond the hobby
   * You will learn if you like making cakes as a job, or not
      * It is something entirely different when one is required to do something with a deadline while feeling extremely lazy, or sick, or stressed
* Look to online blogs about making cakes - you might find some tips that could help you
   * this is the best part of your craft: you will learn interesting shapes and designs that you'd never consider possible
* Make cakes ad nauseam - you will get more practice and more confidence. You will find what works best.
   * Give yourself reasons to bake a cake. Invite friends over for cake and coffee. Offer to make cakes for birthdays. And don't worry about making 10 cakes, if you can afford it. Maybe have 1 cake that you can practice that design you're seeking, and the other cake as the final product for whomever.
      * I knew someone who loved making cakes and she made cakes for everyone for every occasion.
* Identify Market
   * I am from Boston, MA in the US and the one thing that we have plenty is Irish bars, Irish 'pubs', and Irish cooking. I see often a new establishment where Irish something is on offer to add to the collection of Irish-American establishment trying to offer something unique; how unique can another Irish/American place be until it can't be passed as Irish? 
   * As a baker seeking a market, you get peckish and seek donuts or doughnuts or olykoek, if I have the name right. You drive around for 30 minutes and you find a few generic chains that offer what you seek, but you want something different. Finally, after driving an hour away from home you find a shop that offers something with more of a personalized quality - different flavor, different sizes, and different ingredients. BAM! You have yourself an opportunity to add something to the community closer to you. Now the real groundwork is to find out if people are open to a new bakery offering donuts. What works 30 minutes away might not be great in vegantown, UK. That might be the reason why it took 30 minutes to find a location.
* Learn how to effectively run a business
   * Do you want to cater to cake orders online or do you want to have a physical location?
   * What type of cakes do you want to make? Are you offering limited selection of flavors? Are you offering fancy designs found in a wedding cake?
   * What is your competition charging? I saw elsewhere on reddit that wedding cakes are charged 3x more than just the average cake; someone ordered a cheesecake for 2 people and paid about 2-3x the price because it was a wedding cake even though there wasn't much to the design. 
      * Consider this - you think you can stand out and be the baker that can charge half than the rest of your fellow bakers. You try it but find on one particular day that you're having bad luck. The cakes aren't coming out perfect, or you're distracted and the design is shit. So, you try again, and again. Before you know it, the combined effort adds up to more money in time and resources than you would had received just producing other cakes. The extra cost might be because of the planning and consideration going into producing the cake for a wedding. How many people do you know are unsure of the price of their planned wedding cake before pickup?

These are just things to consider. I thought to just answer noticing where your true passion lies. Good luck. "
5070,Today they fired my 83yr old Grandma from work what can she do?,She should have regular medicare and social security?  
5071,Salary raise for an internal promotion?,"Whenever I’ve wangled a better job title, I’ve always been told its “not a promotion” and comes with no extra money, my responsibility has increased organically over the years. So I find myself as Head of Digital at 38 on £50k having never had an official promotion over 2 companies. Doing alright though in spite of this, I reckon. "

Left for $80k new job at 26 last June, lateral move

Just got promoted to Sr. Analyst/rated ""Exceptional"" for a 10% raise to $88k (plus 5% bonus) at 9 months, still 26 "
5074,Current Employer was contacted by a possible employer. How to proceed?,"Ask for a raise. Not necessarily in those words. Just tell the you keep getting hit by recruiters all the time and, if they offer significantly more than you make now you at least talk to them to see what's up. "
5075,My boss is leaving. Should I ask what he honestly thinks about my salary?,"You can do this on your own. See what the salaries are for jobs like yours. The market value is what's important, nothing else. "
5076,"Unpaid interships after graduating college and having done previous internships.., Are you Fucking kidding me?",The only reason to do anything for free is networking so you might eventually be able to use a relationship to get a good job. Being good at something doesn't matter 99% of the time. It's mostly who you know.  
5077,"Graduated, Unemployed, and Attending a Conference. How do I explain that Sciatica has held me back and slowly taken over my life? I'd rather not mention it when networking but how else do I explain what I'm doing in my life?",Hm 
5078,How much notice do I need to give my current employer if I've been here for 6 years and my work is is very specialized?,"Not directly answering the question, but when you're at a senior VP level, don't be shocked if the moment after you deliver your notice, the company waives it and walks you out the door. 

It is legal in Canada for an employer to waive notice, and I suspect legal in the US. Once you give your notice, your employer can say bye bye to you too and it's not considered firing. So maybe choose your timing wisely. 

It would be courteous of you to give 4-weeks (depending on anything that supersedes this in a contract) given your level in the company, but if they are folding anyways, I doubt they would want to retain you for that long. 

Good luck with the new position hopefully! "
5079,"Almost 30, never had a ""real"" job, and feel just as lost on a career path as I did 10 years ago. Where can I go from here?","Repair rare or expensive guitars.

Give private guitar lessons to CEO's or famous people. "
5080,"I m 27 and on a career break and feeling lost already, what should I do?","My best advice is - wherever you work, try to stick it out for a year or two. You were hired to work abroad for a nice salary and you left after a few month? I won't judge you, but damn......that is no bueno dude. That's not the history you want. 

I've been laid off three times, and the lengths of employment were roughly a year or longer, and it still gets me looked at harshly. "
5081,What are some flexible jobs with lots of time off that pay at least 40k?,Any University. 
5082,Is Unlimited PTO a Scam?,"Judging by the responses and anecdotes here, it doesn’t depend on the company but depends on the person. Do you think you would take advantage of it to the point where it becomes a disadvantage? "

I currently have a do nothing job that pays 50K,"I wish I could find a language to learn, I took a few HTML classes, but looking at things like node.js, java, etc. just make my head spin, and unlike I'd say many in the web deving field I can't even bring myself to learn it on my own much less if a company switched to a new language and I had to learn it in 3-6 months.

5090,How do I apply for new jobs when I already work 10 hour days?,"Temp jobs replacing someone leaving a company tend to hire fast and have less interviews. 

It might mean you have to be up a few extra hours to apply to other jobs but it would only be till you find something. Wish you the best! Stay strong. "
5091,What kind of career can I have despite my criminal record?,Lol god dam 
5092,How do you leave the steady career you if you don't even know what else should you be doing?,"You should find hobbies, volunteer, go on trips with family friend . Pick up a book go on adventure. I don’t believe careers or jobs are the end point of living a Fulfilled life, you have to do things that are outside of your career. Start a small business , learn new skills, volunteer go teach somewhere. the possibilities are endless when you have steady income and a flexible job. Make new friends, start dating. "
5093,Anyone Else With A Useless BA Try A Certification?,"This is repeated in a reply to another comment, but I wanted to make sure OP sees it so here is some of it again. To those suggesting you go for nursing(even though that sounds nothing like what you say your strengths are and idk where this idea came from) 

To be a nurse, you have to have 5 years between your charge and the time you get licensed. OP has NO convictions. But nursing programs are very competitive. Paralegal programs can be completed by literally anyone. There is no admission process, unlike nursing, which would include a rigorous course of study before even being allowed into the program, followed by an admittance process. Only 3 states bar someone with a felony from practising law. OP just wants to be a paralegal, not even a lawyer.  Criminal lawyers would arguably be a lot more comfortable employing someone with a criminal history because their clients are criminals or accused criminals and they know that a lot of times shit happens.

OP, my only concern would be that paralegal jobs are going away pretty quickly. Especially since the recession. In fact, many of the jobs are being filled by attorneys who couldn't get work as attorneys. "

5099,What the heck is a 3-hour interview for and how do I conquer it?,"I just finished an interview that was 3 hours:

1 hour wonderlic testing
(2) 45 minute panels
30 minutes negotiating salary

Well structured companies do this for important roles. While I don't personally see the value, it is better than going through 6 rounds of interviews.  I chose to take it as a compliment, since so many members of leadership were willing to make time just for me.  It also helped me to better understand the company and more importantly, thr people and the culture. 

 "
5100,Switch careers to pay off loan?,Maybe get an accounting certificate and go into public accounting? 
5101,How to have conversations surrounding poor performance?,My favorite approach for this is compliment then concern. Tell them how happy you are that that are a part of the team and find something good they they are doing. From there you just say there are a few things that need to be worked on but I have my full confidence you’ll be able to to exceed the expectations. BAM. Go into what’s going on and things that need to be changed. Then just recap the first part how you are happy they are on your team etc and can’t wait to see where they go from that convo.

5103,I have made upwards of $75k a year. I just applied as a fish gut processor for minimum wage. Any starting over advice?,"Where did you apply? I know you moved to Moncton, if it's in the surrounding region most of these places use the Temporary Foreign Worker program to hire people from the Philippines and pay them a few bucks an hour while the government pays the rest: it's usually 14 hour shifts of shitty work that freezes you hands; they do it because they are that desperate for a better life (Philippines is a garbage dump).

I'd recommend looking elsewhere, most jobs I got in Moncton took me a month or more before I got calls back. "
5104,"Start working remote, could you give me some advice?","I have also encountered myself in a similar situation. I have sometimes felt that I was starting to be less productive when being home because of those lunch or coffee breaks with my colleagues that I wasn't taking.

For that, I was thinking to create a platform that would help connect with other people that are in a similar situation. Do you think such a platform could be interesting for people working remotely? It could, for instance, connect people from a certain area to meet when it is lunchtime or even go out for a short break to grab a coffee. "
5105,How can I show past work without breaking confidentiality agreements?,I typically put my stuff on an Amazon S3 server. It costs pennies to the dollar and I can lock and unlock content at will. 
5106,How do I know is time to move on from a job?,"I'm curious about the part of helping to fund the startup. If things go well is there a payout? Would you get that if you left? Does that funding put you in a position to make any changes or give you influence in direction? Could you be in a burnout situation and just need a change or side project? It would be hard for me to walk away from an investment, so my perspective makes me think about staying. "

5112,Is it just me or have you found that the friendly smiling coworkers are the ones you have to watch out for?,"I agree, especially if everything they say is whitewashed and inoffensive in the extreme (i.e. they NEVER upset anyone or seem aggravated). Evil or no, it indicates to me that I'm dealing with someone who is very slick when they socialize and that I should take what they say with a huge grain of salt.  "

I will eventually start to apply for developer role once i gain enough knowledge. Am i doing the right thing ?,"Can you be more specific about what part of mainframes you don't like working on?

5116,I want a different career but I am constrained by my experience and financial difficulties. I have no idea what to do or where to go. What can I do?,How about being a data analyst and possibly working your way up to being a data scientist? There are plenty of great online courses that are way way cheaper than getting another degree. I am currently using DataQuest and it’s fantastic. I’ve heard Datacamp is also good. You could start with quickly learning SQL and data analysis for Excel and even with just that you could probably get your first data analyst job.

5118,"Bachelors last year + 1.5 years job, should I (22F) pursue a masters degree I don't feel like I need?","This is a very personal decision, honestly. It depends on the person and the situation, and changes to either can change the calculus of whether it's ""worth it"" to do a masters. 

Keep in mind, you and your mother are from Eastern Europe - and if she's in her 40s-60s, she's seen a lot of changes to the region, and the attitude there seems to be that more education is better. My Bosnian teacher often complained because ""all of the old professors will not retire, so we all just get extra degrees."" Almost like an educational arms race with your peers. Talk to her about why she's pushing it, and you may be able to come to a better decision for y'all. "

In all seriousness, there are a lot of websites out there that want to try and scam you they want to take your money and they want to waste your time.

The best part is you get to set your own schedule to make your own hours. And of course, the best part you earn profit working from home.

5127,"If you had a good relationship with your boss, would you let him or her know that you are looking for another job?","I think you should clearly voice your issue with the commute to your boss, and ask for what you want. Maybe remote work is an option. Be firm, follow up. 

They’ll either give you what you want. Or they won’t be blindsided when/if you find a new job. "
5128,Is my boss bullying me?,"Thanks for the comments guys! Really helped and made me realise I’m not going crazy.

I’ve realised this isn’t going to stop until my director returns. I have done some digging and on her last maternity leave she was away for 12 months, and I have a feeling she will do the same as she was rather ambiguous when speaking about her return date this year ‘not sure- maybe September’. So unprofessional!

I’m handing in my notice mid-May as I want April’s paycheck.

Thanks again!! "
5129,"What's a good, steady career for an introvert who absolutely hates talking with other people?","Firstly, I'm also an introvert, although I don't hate talking with others. You're probably not going to like this answer, but I would advise working on your hatred of talking to other people before deciding on a career path around that. Ask yourself what you want to do, or think you could be good at, and then figure out whatever accommodations might be necessary to make your work environment as pleasant as possible. Because interacting verbally with others is kind of an essential part of being a human. 

I'm a marketing writer, by the way, and it lends itself quite nicely to both remote work (what I'm doing currently) and working from home. I absolutely can't stand open offices for reasons you probably share and I'm vastly happier since I left my last office job. 

Good luck in making the right  choice - I just hope that it isn't dictated completely by your aversion to human interaction! "
5130,Working 2 full time jobs. How to avoid burnout?,"Don't put yourself through this. It's not worth it. You will burn out. People who burn out have a harder time finding good jobs, getting promoted, and managing their money. So it is a bad economic decision. 

If you're willing to work crazy hours, there are jobs out there that will pay you just as much with just a single job.

I suggest you go back to the HR and manager and tell them you can't work full time and ask them to do it part time like you originally discussed. If they won't, then quit one of the jobs and keep the job that pays the most.

Then, with all this extra time you have, hunt for a better paying job. Tell potential employers you're willing to work 60 hours a week if the pay is enough to compensate for that extra time.

I would not pay down the debt immediately. Build up a 10k nest egg first. It's important to have an emergency fund in case you get laid off or your car breaks down. Just make sure you don't increase the debt. Once you have a nest egg, then you can get out of your family's house and pay off the debt ASAP. "
5131,How do you deal with decision fatigue?,"All the time. Was on a great trajectory up until high school. I was in the gifted program at school, made straight A’s, played sports etc. Then I completely stopped trying for 4 years. Turned it around in college, but I often think about how I would’ve likely gotten into better schools had I stayed focused. Oh well, gotta keep pushing. "
5132,"How could I ever get into these ""jobs for history majors"" I see on internet lists, it feels like I'm so unqualified for anything?",I’ve known retail store managers with history degrees. That’s a possible job path as putting in the time and showing leadership there can get you into the main office and out of the stores eventually. 
5133,I keep getting fired from corporate jobs…what is my next career move??,"Have you every thought of becoming a youtuber?

&#x200B;

I'm half joking. 

&#x200B;

Although it may be far fetched considering your current circumstances, what about becoming a youtuber? Most well-known youtubers started doing vlogs and videos as a hobby, which, for them, blossomed into a career. As a youtuber, you can work on your own time. You also have an outlet for your creative thinking and storytelling. What about doing cooking videos? The downsides with a youtube career, however, is that you're constantly in the public eye, attain both compliments and criticisms from various people, and you're placing yourself in a vulnerable state.   "
5134,"Fired from first Career Job, how should I proceed?","I feel like you grow through wisdom, and you like bringing service to others. If engineering is not suitable for you, then no matter where you go, people will keep saying ""you don't belong with other engineers"". Therefore, find something you are interested. You can work in IT helpdesk, where you help people deal with computer and software problems. It might not pay as much, and be different from your engineering job or careerpath, though you will find the work much more rewarding. I also feel like you have unresolved sorrow and anger issues (which could be related to your frustration in the engineering field). In this case, you are advised to change careers, which is helped by your young age.  "
5135,How can I talking to my boss about excessive travel?,"You should just talk to them about it, period, especially if your current project is wrapping up. I have worked with consultants in IT for a long time (and my spouse works for the big 4)—travel burnout is not at all uncommon. It’s all about how you frame the discussion.  

Rolling off your current project is a really good time to address this with your department head, or resource/staffing person.   Some projects require more travel, some require less.  As you’re wrapping up the current project, just tell them all the good things you have said here, and be positive—as in, “I love what I’m doing, but for my next role, if there is any consideration for less onsite work or a project that is closer to [home], I would like to be considered for it, given the increased onsite presence requirement that my last project demanded.”   We have people asking for lower-travel projects all the time, for tons of different reasons—their health, issues at home, general burnout, etc.  This kind of stress on your body does take a toll, and you have to take care of yourself.  Last year I had a young (<30 years old) consultant  pass away from a heart attack.... before he did, he was texting his boss from the ER because it was go-live.  Not trying to be a downer, just saying to keep perspective.   

It absolutely never hurts to ask, and it’s much easier to be in a position to try and accommodate  this request when you’re going to be placed on your next project, versus you throwing your hands in the air at cutover refusing to travel anymore—which I have also seen, and does not go over well.  You should proceed delicately since I read above that it’s your first project, but if you frame it in a positive way, no one can really fault you for simply asking.   Don’t demand, don’t complain, don’t make comparisons to coworkers or friends’ companies, just ASK for consideration, and frame more as a “less travel now, will do more for next project” kind of way.  In larger firms, it’s also more likely that they could do something about it, since they presumably have a lot more options as to where you could be placed. 

If they are a good employer and value you as it seems they do, they will do their best to accommodate you.  We make every effort to put someone on a lower-travel project after they have been killin it on a FT travel role for the better part of the year.  You have to do what you can to take care of your employees in these kinds of roles, because if you don’t, they will leave.  

Which brings me to my point—if they absolutely can’t decrease your travel or aren’t willing to consider it...or if their pipeline is only mega-travel intensive projects, then start looking for another job. The job market in your industry is insanity right now, if we sleep on getting someone through the interview process by even one day, we are losing people.  

You only get one life, don’t sacrifice your body, health, or sanity for anyone. "

5137,Should I Quit My Steady Job In Order To Focus On My Mental Health While I Look For Something Better?,"So you want to quit...but you need the money and don't want to deplete your savings?  From a financial perspective, yes, it would be irresponsible to quit.  What makes you think you'll be better motivated with another job?

5139,I’m the only engineer/designer at my company of 25 people. I’m getting burnt out. Is this normal?,">  I do my own work alone (immediate design/engineering work, and 5-10year design/engineering work), some production work, and when the sales people are not around, I have to answer phone calls.

I'd be asking for a raise that puts you at your salary + the salaries of the people they'd have to hire to do all the extra stuff you're doing. But even then, what you're doing doing is not sustainable. Ask for a ridiculous raise or for new people to be hired to take those extra hats you're not being paid for. "

5141,Does anyone think that networking has not been helpful to you at all?,"This interview is a great lesson about one of the big reasons why networking is important.  It was because of the power of his network that Jordan Harbinger was able to bounce back quickly when the company he founded fired him.

He also has some great tips on how to network.

5142,What are some careers/jobs that are not 9-5?,"I work as a welder in the oil and gas industry. 10 hour days, 6 days a week are normal. 12 hour days, 5 days a week with 10 hours on saturday and 8 hours on sunday are common. Then you get spells like we're in now, between projects where you work 8 hour days, 4 days a week.

Anything under 60 hours a week is considered banker's hours. 40 hours a week is joked about as being ""part time"".  "
5143,Does having a second screen/monitor help you be more productive and work more efficiently?,Absolutely. I’ve been in a number of roles and each one was best served by having multiple screens to work from. Having just one screen would drive me insane. 
5144,Is it time to leave?,"if my salary gets cut, i would have no loyalty in staying. My bills and debt aren't getting cut, they're still the same most likely, so bye. "
5145,Why am I being told no?,"I don’t know you. But HR managers can typically feel wether a candidate wants a job or not. Like the feeling of wanting it extremely badly to the point they’re motivated to do a lot of things to get it. Maybe you haven’t found a job that you like so much to warrant this type of behavior, and HR probably just feels like you don’t want them enough. 

Like a clingy girlfriend or boyfriend. "
5146,How do you deal with superior who hates you?,I've been in that situation. the company also had a toxic culture. i quit. my biggest mistake was not doing it sooner because i became burned out and am now switching careers.

5148,Take a job that sounds stressful and “just a job” to escape horrible boss?,"The only thing that I will say is that sometimes you may want to take a new job if it will get you on a different path where you want to be. I.e. a foot in the door. Then no matter how bad it gets remember it is only temporary. Make a list of all the things you are currently unhappy with and check it regularly to see what you got away from.

Sometimes you have to roll the dice. They are never any right decisions it is all about living the best you can with the decisions you made "

5151,"After making it on-site to an interview, doing multiple presentations, I was rejected. Now a month later, the position has been reposted. Is it a bad idea to reapply?","As a recruiter, I would suggest to apply again.  A few applications TYPICALLY won't hurt your chances.  A million applications, or applying for every job we post, would hurt your chances. "
5152,Introvert transitioning out of marketing. Can you help me find a path?,"What about becoming a statistician? Might a lot of time at the computer... but it would be mentally stimulating, similar to analytics, and it pays well. "
5153,How do you survive working at a start up without burning out?,"The company will likely do everything they can to indoctrinate you in their culture, their goals, and their mission. Don’t buy in. You should love your work hopefully, enjoy the environment, but the minute you “drink the kool-aid,” and allow yourself to begin working long hours (esp unpaid overtime), you’re done. Love your work, but realize that it’s just a job and for all their startup y’all, they are a company that does not actually care about you.

Now the flip side of that is you have to learn the culture and mission in order to manipulate the bosses so you can move up the latter and get your work/ needs prioritized.

Just my two cents. I’ve been at a start up for 3 years. I’ve done the massive overtime thing, but failed at manipulating management and cultural jargon like some others. I’m done, burnt out to hell.

Edit: wanted to add this: the startup environment can be great. Like another person mentioned, it can be like working with a close group of friends. But that changes as the organization grows. Once you’re over 30-35 people they start to become more corporate while still paying lip service to the startup mentality. (This is what’s happening at my place, and is supposedly quite common based on my conversations with others in similar companies.) "
5154,I was devastated after a staff meeting - how to I move on?,As long as your being paid the same who cares? 
5155,How do you approach applying for new positions after getting fired?,"You don't need to tell them that you were fired for excessive tardiness, because this wasn't the REAL reason you were fired. Look at it this way:

In your words, you were in a ""don't give a shit"" attitude, so you *wanted* to leave. Your tardiness was just a surface manifestation of something deeper—*not being valued by the company.* So instead of up and quitting, you essentially got them to fire you by showing up late. I'm sure you're not the type of person who is incapable of showing up on time. After all, you were in a senior level position.

So, the true reason you and the company parted ways was a difference in what you valued. Sure, on paper they fired you, but the true reason was that you and the company had different values.

Now when it comes to discussing this with potential employers, it's important to present it in an amicable way. Something like you ""outgrew the position"" or are just looking to be challenged further. Personally, if someone had ""drama"" at their last position I'm very suspect as they're bound to repeat history. If you need to use a reference from your last job, it's important you communicate why you left as well, so they understand.

That being said, it's important that you analyze what happened in your last position so it doesn't happen again. I would ask yourself ""How was I complicit in creating the conditions at my last job that I said I didn't want?"" I'm sure the company had some fault as they weren't paying you enough, but it's important to see what part *you* played in not getting payed enough, or not being valued. "
5156,Should I advance my career or live the chill life?,"Stay NYC, ...go out partying phd "
5157,Why would somebody still hire me when I am 50?,Wow you are ignorant. Haha. 
5158,I cry in the office bathroom everydqy. What can i do about the below situation at work?,"Hey man, first things first, I'm sorry you're going through this kind of anguish. Your coworkers are basically exiling you out of the group. And something triggered this change in group behavior. You need to figure out what it was.

Nobody would like being forced into social isolation. However if it gets to the point where it's making you cry everyday and you dread work, that's a red flag against yourself. Did a similar situation ever happen to you during your childhood, like in school or something? And was your reaction the same as now ? You might be a person that is high in agreeableness, maybe you're a very sensitive person.

And that's not a nice thing to be in the average workplace. Like at all. 

The workplace can be very socially intense, there's always an underlying atmosphere of friction and competitiveness. You really don't want to give off the impression that you're too nice and agreeable, too harmless, too emotional, not having the courage to confront people. Or else people will just step over you. I suspect that's what's going on here.

Maybe that girl you mentioned is a polar opposite of you personality-wise. And as a consequence she maybe hates you and has no respect for you and somehow communicated that sentiment to the group and the other co-workers resonated with it. Why would they lie to you over tea or lunch ? Maybe they think you're too soft, maybe they're talking behind your back about how lame you are and how you're probably crying in the bathroom every day. This is just my suspicion, but you tell whether that can be true or not.

Bottom line is that you need to stand up for yourself, and not accept that people lie to your face about not going to tea while you know they are doing so behind your back (make sure you're 100% sure though!). Not accept that they just ignore you by saying they're too busy, which is a total BS excuse btw, don't accept that. If you do, it's over, you're invisible, you don't matter, you're annoying, why bother inviting you? You gotta have some presence, don't be non-confrontational, show that you're not a pushover.

Whatever you do, don't just run runaway to another working environment. Your coworkers will get the last laugh and if you get to a new workplace then it might be the same thing all over again. Or worse.

Whatever you do, wipe away your tears. You allowed yourself to let other people's behavior towards you hurt you. Address the vulnerability and reclaim your emotional stability. Being socially ostracized hurts but maybe you are a part of the problem. Of course the behavior of your coworkers is straight up ""middle-school clique"" childish but hey some people are just immature / just as insecure as you and they will follow the group like sheeps.

Hope some of this helps, I used to be very shy, sensitive, agreeable, but now I'm not a pushover anymore and I don't accept shit from anyone. I encourage you to hold yourself to a fair standard "
5159,Did anyone use edX (online learning) certificates to bolster or change careers?,"following for interest
 "
5160,Do coding boot camps actually get you jobs?,"THis was surveyed (n=100000) in the Stack overflow career survey.

https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/

Long story short, 55% of those didn't have a developer job, and most eventually got a job (within a year), only about 9% of total did not get a job (so basically ~20% of jobless bootcamp grads). "
5161,Job for quiet person who wants to work their way up the ranks?,"Are people-oriented, higher-powered jobs harder for quiet people? They can be, but it depends on the person. One friend is a super introvert, and uses up her people-energy in her very people-oriented job. She loves it, but it means she doesn’t come to drinks with us very often. Another friend was initially hesitant to take a more people-oriented job, but found that people take his input more seriously BECAUSE he doesn’t talk constantly. 

I’m not sure what your role as an assistant editor entails, but there are some communications roles that really don’t require a lot of people-interaction. Larger companies, weirdly, are going to be better, because each job can be more specific, instead of a five-person team where everyone is overlapping job duties a bit. 

As for whether management roles are harder to get if you’re quiet, it depends on the company. It can take longer to be noticed and offered up for a management role. However, sometimes the quiet ones have paid more attention and do better than the loud ones. For example, one of my best supervisors was a woman who was originally hired into the same role I had. I had been with the company a couple years, and actually helped train her. She was quiet and watchful and asked excellent questions. When our supervisor left, I was unsurprised they offered her the job, but she was TERRIFIED that I would resent her promotion. I told her honestly that I was terrified that they would try to promote me, because working with her had shown me that I didn’t sit back quietly and WATCH and digest nearly as much as I should have been! So, take that anecdote as you will. 

And good luck! "

5168,What're some good careers for a 53 year old single mother to pursue? (My mom),"I have to be honest. Your mom is my age, 53. She has two kids to take care of, and her time to go to school and get a different career is over. When your sister and you leave there is going to be LESS manual labor around the house. She has 14 years before she hits retirement age. She needs to think about a job that requires no education. You mom , at the age of 53, is still doing entry level jobs that teenagers do. She is not good with computers so doing entry level office work along side 20 something people who are good with computers will hurt. 

&#x200B;

I know that is a harsh reality for you but you need to see the real picture. You are a good kid for being concerned. Yo have to realize that your mom is never going to get enough out of social security to retire comfortably. You and your sister are going to have to take care of her until she dies.

All three have their pros and cons. And, again, the interviews went great.

5171,Has anyone moved on from a career you wanted really badly because nothing ever worked out no matter what you tried?,"Yeah. I wanted to work in International Diplomacy either for an NGO or the State Department.

Fortunately, then my current (technical writing then software development) career started doing much better at least financially to the point that when the State Department finally got back to me I had to turn it down because it would have meant a steep pay cut. 

Which now I also have a family that matters more than any one particular career field.

5188,"In your opinion, which has the more likelihood of getting an interview; applying on a job board (such as indeed or angelco) versus applying on the company website directly?","I manage user experience at a job board and recruiting company; if the board has a special affinity like, 'Professional Engineers,' or, 'Traveling Medical Personnel,' the employer may have certain triggers set up to have more visibility from those applicants because they're probably measuring ROI from that resource, or targeting diversity communities through certain resources, i.e. veterans.

The other benefit is that you usually also have to create a profile with that board, which depending on your goals might expose you to other great opportunities passively.

That said, buying a cup of coffee for the person you'd be working for because you did your research on LinkedIn or by calling the company directly will always be the gold standard for a deliberate, eager candidate. I sometimes assume that when people mail in their resume to work with us without personal follow up that they're just not who we want in our culture. "
5189,"I was fired, but don’t know what I’m supposed to learn from this experience or what to say in interviews?","1. Get on unemployment, and enjoy it. (Best time of my life was when I was on it.)
2. If you don't use them as a reference then just say you quit.
3. Don't overthink it. You sound stressed, and it definitely sucks. I have been there too. But it's just work, don't let it take over your life. It's not a death sentence. You'll move on to something new. 


Side note - I don't know if you can just fire someone for ""outgrowing the role"". That doesn't sound ethical on their part. "

5200,Lawyers: Do you guys like your job? Should I do it?,"I'm not a lawyer in the US, but I work for an international law firm, and I'm basically starting out at the lowest level.   
Pros: the pay is very comfortable, I know for a fact that it is much more than other lawyers at a similar level in other firms which aren't international. I can pay for my own car and medical insurance, gym etc and even get to save for an overseas holiday at the end of the year.  
Cons: the working hours. On your employment contract it might say office hours are from 8:00-4:30, but really, you're staying until 6-7pm at least, or as late as your director stays. If he/she works on weekends, you'll be expected to do the same. It's nearly impossible to have a life outside of work, every one of your bosses will give you work which they say is urgent, and you won't know who to prioritise, and none of them will care that you have deadlines from other people.  
I completely understand why people talk you out of it, and personally, after my 2 years at this firm is up, I'm leaving to figure out what else I can do with my degree and experience, which I know there are other options. It's really important that if you do choose law, you understand that it's a lot of sacrifices and hard work, but that if you're willing to go that mile, you will be able to live comfortably.  "

5202,I unknowingly struggled with dyslexia while in college and graduated with a terrible GPA. What can I do to prove to graduate school that I deserve to be there?,"I found out that I am dyslexic during my senior year of college as well, so I completely understand your struggle.

I didn’t decide to persue grad school, can’t afford it, but going into the workforce I decided that it *wouldn’t* be in my best interest to disclose my dyslexia and use it as an excuse for my poor grades in college. 

There’s still a massive stigma and tons of misunderstanding that surrounds dyslexia. Basically, most people think that if you’re dyslexic you’re illiterate. Really. That’s the response I’ve gotten from most people. 

Grad school might be different. I’d consider disclosing your struggle with them, but tread carefully once you start applying for jobs.  "
5203,Have anyone given up the idea of 'career' and just hop jobs to jobs as long as it pays bills?,Get a job with a large company (or local government for a large city) and just position hop if that suites you. I work for local government and have been in 3 different positions in the last 5 years. Started as a temp at $9 an hour and now I permanent full time making $18.72 an hour. The positions I’ve held are generally not related except they all work for the same city so my paycheck never changed and same W2.

Maybe my advice is to pick a skill-based job like making posters or copywriting and stick with it while slowly learning whatever new skill you want.

If in the end you don't want to shift then youre already valuable in your field.

If you shift, then that skill should somehow complement web design or UIUX.

Hang in there! We'll make it. "

5207,Why is employer branding so fake?,"Companies who are transparent and authentic about their work culture will win out in the end. It's no secret that most people's motivation for working at a company is to sustain their lifestyle, financially and otherwise.  As a strategist, I've done hundreds of EB videos for Fortune 500 companies and always steer clients in the direction of making their content about the person and NOT the brand. And empowering employees to speak their truth (not always easy). Force-fed corporate values that aren't true and furthermore, not important to potential candidates, is a waste of time and resources.

5208,"Those of you who spend little/less time on a computer for work, what do you do?","Construction has a wide variety of jobs ranging from all desk to all field, to everywhere in between. It’s also rather flexible depending on where you’re best suited so you have to opportunity to try things and see what sticks.

5209,Going back to school for tech at age 30?,"I could be wrong, but 65/hour is an upper limit for anything hourly/salary. If its that hard , you may want to treat it like an athlete or a first responder. Stick it out until you have a good retirement going, then if you dont want a pay cut look for something in investing or business owning (high dollar sales potential), where a good sale/investment can make that years w-2 look good.

5210,What are signs that you're NOT going to get fired?,"Asking this question makes me think that you are incompetent. Not trying to offend you but if you get fired pretty easily that means you:

• Cannot follow instructions

• Do not do a good job

• Don't have a good personality

&#x200B;

Otherwise, it's freakin difficult to get fired if you do the 3 above. I have never in my life been worried about getting fired and I have never been fired. I've always exceeded expectations and I work well with others.

There's definitely things that you are not sharing and/or you are not aware of that turns people off.  "
5211,"Entry-level job asking for 5+ professional references that I don't have, what should I do?",I'll be a reference for you. 
5212,"Hiring managers and HR pros, how do you make salary, raise, and promotion decisions? What should I enforce as a manage and what should I expect as an employee?","I make salary decision based solely on performance and tenure. If you've worked for me for 3 years and are a subpar employee making as much as someone who works 2 months for me, I'll give you a bump when I give you a review, with the understanding that it is only a small bump and based on performance they could get more in 3 to 6 months. 
The important thing to know is people talk about their rates, no matter what you tell them. So keeping your people whole is important, especially on a staff 20 to 50 people. If people aren't performing I will not give them a beg merit increase or raise and tell them why. I will give them something just not a lot. Because if your not pulling your weight and not turning it around the are other people that will want their job. 
Promotions I normally make when there is room and the person can fit the position, not wholly, on a basic level. I make the decision based on their prior work and performance. If you want a promotion show me you want it. Attitude and how they talk to others is the most important. I dont need lower managers talking down to employees.   "

5214,"They think I am an Architect, what should I do?","As long as you don’t call yourself a licensed architect or try to stamp official documents/plans as a licensed architect you should be fine. If a client asks you directly, you can always say that someone else will be stamping and signing the plans you submit to the state office. Keep making money, don’t worry about your coworkers.  It’s their problem for misunderstanding and not your job to correct them. Sounds like you’re doing well.

Many of the licensed architects I’ve met are gatekeeping morons. Never lifted a hammer or understand what they’re ‘designing’. Especially boomers that rely on the younger generation to produce documents. Either learn competitive skills that are industry standard, or retire.  Point being; if you do your job well and are compensated accordingly, you’re actually in a good place. Let somebody else take on all the liability and you do you. "

5220,I was asked during interview if you like work or money more. I do think money but I'm a fresh graduate so I don't know if I will like work more. Is there a correct answer?,"The correct answer is 'work', but either the question was shittily phrased or you're relaying it some what inaccurately.

What the question is trying to ask is, say you have two jobs, A and B. And let's say they both pay the same, let's say $60K just for argument's sake. If you have two offers, you'll take the job that seems to have the best work, obviously.

But let's say B pays $65K. Do you automatically take B? Or do you take A if the work is clearly better? What if it's $70K? $80K? $100K?

The 'correct' answer - and by 'correct' I mean actually correct and not just 'interview correct' - is that you prefer the better job \_unless\_ the pay for that job is clearly not market, i.e., you're being taken advantage of. Now, it's incredibly unlikely that a job will both have good work and be making a substantially below market offer. So it's a pretty artificial question. 

But let's look at a somewhat real comparison. You have two offers. One is an $80K entry level developer job at what seems to be a good company. The other is a $110K job as a union garbage collector. Which one do you take? "
5221,Stuck in a low paying job and a niche industry for 7 years. is it a good idea to take a slow half-year or one-year break if one has little financial burden for rest and new skills?,"Develop a solid plan for whatever skills you want to develop. In terms of rest, unless you’ve been in a high stress industry for a few years, 3 months of rest is heaps. But if you’re serious about developing your skills, it won’t feel like rest if you only have 3 months. 

It’s only going to better for your career if you a) develop new skills that will directly help you succeed in your future career, or b) you are finding it hard to continue progressing due to burn out, and you need that mental refresher. 

It’s easy to romanticise a short term break from the work force to work on yourself, but it’s very easy to waste more than half your time away on just rest, and truth be told, very few of us actually NEED that much rest before we can perform at our peak.  "

5228,Why are so many people against choosing a career(lucrative degree) mostly for the pay?,"Computer science. I have an art background as well and want to go to school again for it one day ( spent 4 years in a performing arts high school as a visual arts student), but it's so, so expensive, even though my major would make me money.


The transition honestly isn't bad because you can create things. I knew I had to do what you did and pick something that would make me money but I wouldn't hate. I started self teaching for the first 8 months and enrolled in a few year-long intensive that's free for my demographic. I graduate in 3 months and start applying for a job in 1. Will probably be making 60-80k. I could have learned all I did and been employed in 8 months of I had a sense of direction when I was self teaching honestly. 


But yeah, I can use my knowledge to do game dev too once I get settled in at my job (just to do it on the side) and use my new skills to create things and keep my visual skills sharp. Then I'm going to animation school after saving a good 3 to 5 years and not really changing my lifestyle much (living in an apartment that costs what mine already does, living with my SO so we split half the utilities still). Paying for 28k a year for school will be easy. Can even do freelance dev on the side while I'm in school to keep the money rolling in. "

5230,Where can I find 100% remote W-2 employment?,"Some Medical Coder positions are work-from-home now. A one-year technical diploma is all the credential you need to get in the door, and you probably would be able to get credit for past coursework (e.g. Medical Terminology).

Some call centers have also gone to work-from-home, so that might be another thing to look for.

If you have good basic tech skills, IT help desks can be work-from-home, but some will require a degree in an IT field. Others may essentially be resetting passwords and escalating more complicated problems to the next tier of support. "
5231,When should I start applying to jobs in a city I want to move to?,"These are all great questions that I have been thinking about and have played a huge part in the decision to move to the city I picked! But I do need to try and form an answer as to how this fits in my career change...

5234,What is a day as a market research analyst like?,"I work as an analyst for a market research consultancy, which means we contract with a variety of MR providers and provide value adds like project management and reporting. I spent most of my weeks helping test surveys and building reports for larger research efforts being managed by senior staff. I also manage one client of my own (was two, lost the contract with one of them), which means I’m in charge of sample, proofing the invite emails, and working with our vendor on keeping the reporting platform meeting the client’s needs. It’s a really interesting field, but the pay isn’t amazing. Overall, though, I’d recommend it.  "
5235,I’m worried about working 50 Hours/Week and going to Grad School. Has anyone experienced something similar and can give me tips on how to get through it?,Hm.

5237,"I frequently read from people on Reddit who earn $150k+ salaries. As a 35 year old, is it too late for me to get into one of those fields?","Hi, I noticed you are considering a career change. I personally left sales after 9 years, which I wasn't good at since I wasn't passionate about the profession and therefore struggled financially. 6 years later I've transitioned into the Project/Program Management consulting field and have been thriving. It is never too late to rebrand yourself and get what you want.

So what is it you're finding challenging in transitioning careers?

Also, what I have found helpful is thinking, 'what would this look like if it were easy?' So my question to you is what would you be able to accomplish if you could easily transition to a new career? "
5238,"Company refuses to promote worthy people, forces them out, then advertises their job at higher grade. Why?","Not necessarily common practice.

5240,How to transition out of a higher ed career?,I second others' advice about finding a more administrative role within higher education first. I've been contemplating the same thing about my interests for some months now. I've been wondering if my interest in student interaction as a whole is beginning to wane or if my underlying urge to return to my old institution is keeping me from establishing student (and staff) relationships here. 
5241,What can a recently moderately crippled person realistically do for work?,"You could try teaching English online! I have Crohn's disease and teach English online and really like it. That being said, I'm sure my situation is very different from yours. I am often mostly fine, and then completely incapacitated in the case of a serious flare-up whereas it seems your condition is more constant. Only you'll be able to say if teaching English online could for you, but it's a possibility. The most demanding parts of the job are waking up early in the AM and that you need to be high energy for a long period of time. Depending on your timezone, you'll be working around 7pm Beijing time, which is 6am Eastern Standard Time, and you need to sit through 30 minute lessons, have only 5 mins break in between lessons if you book them back to back (though you don't need to). In general, I think the flexibility of the job might make it accessible to you. One good thing about the job is when I had a recent flare-up I was able to take about 2 weeks off completely to recover, with no penalties, and then could gradually start teaching again at my own pace.  


Anyways, [here's a post I made about the job.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/dsi205/my_review_after_several_months_teaching_english/) Please PM me if you have any questions, and good luck with finding work. I truly hope and believe there is something fulfilling out there for you! "

5262,What is it really like being a lawyer?,"I have only worked in litigation, so I can’t speak to non-lit jobs. But I’ve worked in various areas and various sized firms. Litigation is deadline-heavy, places a tremendous amount of pressure because a wrong move can cost your client their case. Every day you face a new legal issue, much of the time you don’t have great guidance. The field does teach you to teach yourself, which is certainly a nice skill to have. But it’s extremely stressful, not much work satisfaction, and lawyers are 3x more likely to suffer from depression (me being one of them). The pay is not enough for most lawyers to pay down their loans at the rate that those loans are growing with interest. Hours are long, you are almost always expected to work longer than everyone else and in litigation, you have unexpected late nights regularly. As a mom, this is extremely difficult because I have daycare pick up, so causes an issue with my husband’s work schedule. The worst part of litigation IMO is that your opponents are out to crush you in order to win, and that creates a very combative and hostile work environment. It takes a certain personality to be a bulldozer. As for non-lit jobs, I never chose to do them because what I have been exposed to I’ve found dreadfully boring. I absolutely love the law, from a theoretical standpoint, and yet I regret and resent the fact that I became a lawyer. It makes me sad that I feel this way, having planned to be a lawyer since I was in middle school, but it’s the truth. Law school is an extremely expensive financial decision that could have a serious impact on your financial future, so be aware of that when you go into it. "

This does several magic tricks at the same time:
1. Boss man now knows you understand what the day to day tasks may entail
2. Boss man knows you did your research and you're already looking for the best ways to help out

5272,I have access to 24 months of FREE scholarship! What should I do with it?,"Can you save it for a future kid?? While if you need help getting/finding a career, I’d advise using it for that, but if you think you’re fine from an education perspective and can use it for a future child then that’s an even greater ROI. "
5273,How do you know if you're happy with a job? Is the grass greener on the other side?,The grass is always greener on the other side  
5274,Nearly 30 and still unsure what I would like to do as a career that I enjoy. Can anybody give me advice based on my situation?,"I'm in a similar spot and I decided to teach myself programming and am currently job searching. But I would really recommend trades, truck driving, salesforce, or underwriting.  "
5275,Management is discussing changing my role from 9-5 to on call overnight. What should I do?,"It sounds like you're getting ahead of yourself.  If I understand the situation, at this point there's simply a lot of talk and discussion.  Wait until they have a firm direction and see what they offer.  In the meantime, don't worry about it.  "
5276,"My wife has spent the last 5 years raising our children, what should she do now?","Real estate license?
property management? (They often only require high school diploma and good work ethic.)

Edit: downvoting this just because you don’t like the suggestion is a dumb thing to do when the post is asking for suggestions. I’m just saying. "
5277,I have too much freedom at work and don’t know what to do with it. How can I structure my day and do more with my time?,Host Airbnb experience focus on wildlife. You tell your boss that's a regular fieldwork event and pocket the whole money. Win-win solution 
5278,Remote workers: How to give notice over the phone?,"Honestly many companies are chronically understaffed.  That points to severe issues with upper management as I can attest to (but maybe its other things, but really, its probably that they are too profit motivated and small visioned to understand that additional resources can lead to more profit).

5282,"Wife is stuck in a career hole, what can I do to help?","Did your wife maybe think about trying to start her own private psychology sessions? She could probably manage the time in any way she wishes, work on her career field and get paid well enough (with time).

I graduated in 2016 and I’ve been working for the past 2 years as a data scientist. I had been planning on going into academia, this was never on my radar while studying. 

It’s a pretty sweet gig, lots of demand, and I’m just slightly ahead of the wave so people with my level of experience are going to be in demand for the foreseeable future. Money is not bad too, though I’m in western EU so it’s nothing like the crazy US salaries I see on Reddit. 

The work is super satisfying. Hands on, challenging, feels like you have super powers when things actually work, and an infinite stream of new things to learn. All in all it worked out great! "

5289,Jobs That Don't Require You To Work After Hours At Home or Work on Days You Ars Supposed to be off?,"A good portion of that is based on your company, department, and manager rather than job.

In supply chain management, only working 40 hours a week in a salaried position is rare. On my team I think a few people average 40 hours a week and everyone else works less. Other coworkers I work with who have a different manager and who work in a different department work closer to 50 a week. So it really just depends. "

5295,How can a burnt out detective with limited skills outside of law enforcement find a new career?,"You've already put in 9 years, you're probably not that far away from retirement.  Private sector jobs suck compared to LE.  Lots of people would kill to have your job but they can't to it bc of some disability,  mistake in their past etc.  Imagine 20 or 30 years from now.  Don't you want a pension, health insurance etc?  Those things are hard to find in private sector. "
5296,Is this email okay for reaching out to an old boss/mentor?,"This post just inspired me to reach back out to my mentors at my old job. I just texted them to say hi, offer to catch up, and said thanks again.

Great email too if you need a 20th confirmation :) "
5297,Boss suddenly changes his mind about the performance of people threatening to leave. Should I try this?,"If you worked there for a few years and already had a few promotions, are you expecting a promotion for every good deed you do for the company? Not trying to jab you but your expectations aren’t realistic.

Just because you want a promotion and think you are doing a good job doesn’t mean you DESERVE a promotion.

Anyone who works in the real world knows you get promoted if you do good work, go above and beyond, and last but most important... if an opportunity opens up. That last part is crucial because no company is going to create a new position or create a logjam at an existing position because someone thinks they deserve a promotion.

If you threaten to leave your current job for another as a negotiating ploy, you better do it if they back you into a corner. Don’t get caught trying to reach into the cookie jar if you aren’t willing to deal with the consequences. "

5301,"Are there any well paying jobs, that don't involve sitting around in an office?",That’s interesting. Never thought of it. Right now I work in the fabrication shop at a fire sprinkler company. Physical labor and driving around a lot. I don’t hate it and the company is fantastic but I try to keep my eyes open for opportunities like that.  
5302,What’s your advice for a 40 year old career changer?,"Medical assistant, dental assistant, speech pathology assistan. Good growth is forecast, not too much additional school. "

Why not just tell them and make everyones life easier? "
5304,My boss is asking me to do things outside of my job description. I'm afraid it's getting out of hand. How can I turn this around?,I would figure out a solution. Either make the website or get someone who will. I was hired as a web developer. My work was going to hire an outside photographer to do the pictures for the website. I showed them my portfolio and now I am doing it. Now I actually have professional photography work under my belt which is pretty cool because it was just a hobby of mine before this. 
5305,"Want to quit my first job after the first shift, what do I do?",liberals 
5306,Does your companies Glassdoor review realistically represent what its like to actually work there?,Ugh. I'd like to leave Glassdoor reviews but they locked me out of my account and won't do anything to allow me to get it back. That site is pure shit.  
5307,Unclear how to ask for a raise in my circumstance?,Only way to get a raise in todays world is via landing a new job. 
5308,"33, getting trapped in food service/retail?",Sounds like you were looking for a shortcut and it backfired. It'll take more than paying thousands of dollars to attend a short coding boot camp. 
5309,How do i get a job i have no experience in?,"Did you do any marketing for any clubs/classes in school? Definitely feel free to incorporate that into a resume. Also, as has been stated on this thread, find free work that you can do to market someone's business/non-profit/club. Everyone could always use more marketing, especially if it's free "
5310,How do I negotiate salary when my responsibilities are doubling?,I would split the difference and complete your new tasks well for 3 months then request a meeting with your boss and ask for a raise 
5311,"Should I dump my current somewhat stressful job with better pay and rotating schedule for a 9-5 M-F, less stressful job with a $400/month pay cut?","That makes sense.  Since there is a potential for OT with the new role that makes it tough.  Are you planning on having kids, if so, anytime soon? Thinking about that, does the schedule difference either hurt or help you? Does your boyfriend have any disposable income that could go towards your loans once you're married? Would you be more upset turning it down and not finding another similar opportunity OR getting the job and having less money over the years? "
5312,How many of you actually got to your current job by sending out resumés to job openings?,"Find out who the hiring manager is. Take the time to reach out to them and introduce yourself/express serious interest in the position. If your resume is about average compared to what they've been getting and you have fair communication skills, doing the above should get you some interviews and at the very least, give you some candid conversation about why you haven't been getting any in the past "
5313,"Work is increasing my hours by 25% while cutting my pay by 40%, what should I do?","This is report time to whatever labor board you have - just give them this same info. Also name and shame is possible, because people need to know how companies treated their employees when shit hits the fan like it is now. I would like to know what company to never, ever, EVER work for. 

My company just bumped up my pay an extra $2 for 6 weeks...for now. "
5314,Should I take a better paying job or be a “team player”?,"Look out for yourself. Does it matter if you're a team player if you make less than a living wage? Get what you're worth, never worry about being a team player. "
5315,Whats a marketable skill that I can acquire in 2-3 months that can help me switch careers and work remotely?,!remind me 2 days! 
5316,"My best talent is being able to mind my own business (the personal, not financial kind). How do I turn this into a career?","that’s not a talent. so what you’re saying is: you have no talent, how do you make that a career? well, you don’t. sorry buddy, your stuffed til u work at something, get good at it and stop being *a whiny cunt "
5317,Changing careers from corporate world to... anything else?,"Thank you all for your comments! 

I studied science and am working in customer-facing finance. Neither the industry or discipline is where I want to be in 5 years, in 10 years. But by that point I likely won't be in Vancouver anymore haha "
5318,"Can someone explain to me what a career in ""communications"" or experience in ""communications"" would entail or include?","We have a few Comm grads on our team. And some folks with a PR background. I do technical recruiting. Not really something most people think about, rather more or less fall into.. but I love it! "
5319,Got offered a position in my company. Boss tried to back out of offer and give himself some wiggle room. What should my next move be?,"I’m a manager and one of my guys was thinking of moving like this. I didn’t really want him to because I imagined him taking my job fairly soon. I’d ask. Why and what’s coming up this year that’s better then this role that they say doesn’t fit. Also job hunt at all times, at least passively.  "
5320,"Just published my first book, How to Write the Perfect Resume, free on Amazon. Check it out!","Dan, thanks for writing this book, can\`t wait to buy it :) "
5321,Anyone here was or is a late bloomer in their careers? Why did it take so long for you? How did you cope?,Late bloomer here too! I didn’t graduate until I was in my 30s and was still doing jobs that paid around $27/hour whereas people my age in my social circle are making in the six figures. I feel like shit. I just recently got my big break by getting a short term project management job but I am not sure if it will take me further or not my life is pretty unpredictable. But I am hoping I can then my life around and catch up.  
5322,"26 and never pursued a career, where to learn about my options?",Try becoming a youtuber? Maybe stream video games on twitch? I’m in a similar situation so I just keep trying new things and never stop. 
5323,Interview as a data analyst with no background: advice?,"Yeah, hard skills are teachable and I've never personally disqualified a candidate that didn't have specific hard skills.

5324,"I've been trying to relocate and having a hard time landing anything beyond a phone interview, who has had success in this and how have you gone about it?",">I've had folks tell me that although they believe that I sound very serious about what I am trying to do, we look like a risk because we aren't already living somewhere

I've always wondered why that would be such a risk.  One time when I was unemployed, I considered looking in other areas for jobs and applied for a few out of state.  I got calls back from the recruiters about them, but they'd say they were hesitant to hire someone from out of state or wouldn't pay for relocation (which was fine with me).  At the same time, sometimes I get contacted from recruiters about jobs all across the country..  It seems like some places are afraid to hire from out of state, and some aren't.

Also at that time, I was contacted by a hiring manager at a company within my state but in a different city, about 3-4 hours drive from where I was living.  At first I wasn't sure I'd want to move there, so I didn't respond, but he contacted me again a week later and I decided it wouldn't hurt to try.  I suppose the hiring manager liked what he saw on my resume to contact me again.  I made it through the phone interviews and in-person interview, and they hired me.  So I guess if a place likes you enough and you seem to fit in, you have a chance. "
5325,Entry level jobs that teach valuable skills?,Military. 
5326,How to find my path after 19 years at age 43?,You spent 19 years at age 43?! How did you do it? 
5327,My boss has given me a month to come up with a 5 year plan. What do I do?,"Make a list of the following that you'd think would be nice to have in the future (5 years):

* Things for yourself.
* Things for your loved ones and friends.
* Things for your career.
* Things for your company.
* Things for your boss.
* Things for your customer.
* Things for your community.

If you can find things that are on multiple lists, especially overlapping the lists that you'd think your boss and/or upper management would care about, it might be a good point on your plan. "
5328,Last day of work. Should I throw awful managers under the bus ?,"100% throw them under the bus. Even better if you have documentation of all the incidents. And if you don’t have documentation just make up some dates and recall the incidents.

It sounds like they deserve to get fired. I’m a manager and pride myself on treating my employees with respect and dignity. Fuck em "
5329,Is it okay to quit after you pass probation ?,its literally the same you quit day1. the consequences are arguably the same. 
5330,Certifications worth getting?,OSCP is perfect uwu 
5331,Evaluation interview after 3 months @ big 4 - should I tell them that I want to quit ?,"This is why they have the evaluation review, so you can tell them these things and they can help you solve the issues.

If you’re quitting after only 4 months (actually 2 months) then you’re pretty soft and not disciplined. "
5332,I'm 30. I want to change career...but to what?,"On YouTube type ""Jordan Peterson career choice"". He explains brilliantly how you should select a career based on your big5 inclinations. Basically, choose a career based on your lifestyle preferences, do you like making friends/meeting new people? Do you like working alone/small teams? Do you like rules and meeting deadlines? Do you like to be told what to do and how to do it or do you like complete independence?

We all have varied interests that we can pursue without having to make it a career hence, choose career on lifestyle preferences, interest coming in a close second. "
5333,"New Yorkers/Americans, what are the best job hunt websites or strategies to use when applying?",I got 4 $200k+ job offers from LinkedIn. All the jobs I saw on indeed were trash. It’s worth paying for LinkedIn premium for a few months. 
5334,Career ideas for people who can't sit still?,How do you become a billionaire's son and go to ivy league schools to become president even when you are an academic failure and possibly retarded? 
5335,What are some lesser-known trades?,Knife sharpener 
5336,Would you rather be an SVP at a large public company making $400K or the Founder/CEO of a growing small business making $300K?,"Founder, because I have job security and I assume equity in the company that I can sell and retire. "
5337,How do you find time to learn?,"Echoing everyone else on this thread - you need to carve dedicated time.  


I'd also say sometimes these ""times"" are less than ideal for caregivers - networking occurs after work hours, sometimes courses are offered on the weekends. All of these are choices. I see a lot of working parents struggle in balancing ""getting ahead"" because they're not as available to take advantage of these ""off-hour"" activities.

5338,"I work at Amazon UK, I have proof Senior Management lied to us, and screwed a few of us over, How do I write this letter?","I read this point twice and I still don't understand what the issue is.  There's a lot of detail, so it's not that you're being vague...perhaps I didn't get enough sleep last night.  Have you thought about a career writing Terms & Conditions for a software company?

I'm guessing that you feel you were treated unfairly.  Don't write the letter.  Spend your energy looking for another job. "
5339,"Received job offer from 2nd choice, how and when do I tell 1st choice? We already have a second interview scheduled","You don't have to say anything to your first choice, unless and until they make you an offer.

What you need to do is to make it clear to your second choice that you need some time before you can give them an answer. "
5340,"new job lied about working from home and is now at location, any advice?","I'm guessing you didn't get any of that in writing. This is why you get things like that in writing. Remember this for next time. For now, if it's not in your contract, you're not a work from home employee, either get used to it or find a new job. "
5341,How do you distinguish between a dream and a career that suits you?,"I relate so much to this and I am an ENFJ too. Wanting to make a positive impact in society is something I think, I want to do. But I just can't figure out what career choices are there that suits me as well. :( "
5342,"Company now expects me to work overtime despite receiving a 25% pay cut due to COVID-19 and never receiving any sort of overtime pay, how should I proceed?","Show a little loyalty and step up if you can. This is an unprecedented time and not one to feel entitled about having a job unless you are extremely marketable skill set. If your co-workers are stepping up as asked, you don’t want a target on your back by bucking the trend. This won’t last forever but you need to consider that the alternative could be worse. Sounds like your employer may be better than where you could end up if you quit or get laid off. "
5343,Any tips and tricks to shake nervousness for an interview?,I took a shot of bourbon before any interview and it relaxed me. Just make sure to wash your mouth before interview. 
5344,"About to quit my current job as I'm on the cusp of getting fired, but I started/am in the middle of A LOT of personal development. Advice on career shifting and development?","Hey everyone, I just got home and started reading these comments. I appreciate y'all's sentiment and your advice is sound, but it's kind of a personal pride issue for me getting fired. Also, if I ever try to get a job with this hotel chain again (which is a possibility in the future, but different story altogether) then that won't be possible since I have a termination on my record. But I'll be fine job wise, the market here is pretty healthy and people are going to need employees left and right once the busy season starts up. But that being said, I put in my 2 weeks earlier this morning without getting a chance to read y'all's advice. I'm not butthurt about it, I felt like I grew a lot personally and this was the type of bruising that I needed to drive the message through! Either way, I'm gonna read through all the comments and hopefully spark some dope discussion, bc I know there's a lot of experience out there to take in. I might go back to school, I might get in shape and finally chase my dream of joining the military (whole other story) but no matter what, I'm gonna squeeze a diamond out of this turd. "
5345,Can't Do Business Professional Dress for Interview -> Automatic Disqualification?,"Since it's an entry level position, they might be more lenient, but it would be preferable to reschedule and get a suit. "
5346,"Started a new job 5 months ago and want to work from home, how do I approach my boss?",Look up Tim Ferriss. He wrote the book “the four hour work week.”He does a whole step by step section on how to accomplish this topic. I believe he has YouTube videos and info on his blog so you don’t have to read the whole book right now.  
5347,Best place to look for jobs?,"SimplyHired, Glassdoor, Uncubed, LinkedIn, The Muse, VentureFizz
 "
5348,Is it okay to have different versions of your CV that highlight different work experience?,"I have a super long one that lists every detail of every job, it’s 4 pages (I’m 50+).

I read that Hillary Clinton & Barack Obama have one page resumes. That blows my mind.  "
5349,"People who struggled to choose a career, how did you eventually decide?","Still haven't really decided, but in college I just applied to a whole bunch of jobs and took a sales job at a big-name tech company. 4 years later decided to get my MBA to switch to marketing (I liked it better as it's more strategic, incorporates data, consumer psych and creativity, plus I didn't have that ""sales"" personality). Finishing up MBA now and have a job offer in CPG marketing. "
5350,How do you figure out what to do with your life?,"I know you might not think it, but 24 is way NOT too late.  You still have a good 6-10 years to just straight up f-up.  Just kidding.  Don't do that. 
Most of us are not blessed with that mythical straight trajectory of career path and success.  We bounce around, do survival jobs, try stuff, fail, give up, try different stuff.  All well carrying around debt and low self esteem because it seems like everyone else is steaming ahead. 
I don't have any answers, but I hear you, and so do a lot of people. 
I would say at your age do whatever you can to get a change of scenery, and try living somewhere else. It's easier when you are younger. That could be the trigger that changes your whole outlook.  "
5351,"I'm a 48-year-old mom of 3 looking at a second career. I made the wrong decisions once, how do I make sure I don't mess up again?","What state are you in? For most, all you need is a teaching license which can be obtained in like 6 weeks online. You definitely do not need a bachelors or masters in education to be a grade school teacher. 

How are your art skills? I would make sure there is a respectable portfolio. Maybe start at a smaller city school or day care and work into a grade school. If you don’t need the money, you could also volunteer at some city programs to help mentor young kids with questionable backgrounds. Locally there is a great program that sponsors after school art programs for kids with special needs, kids that can’t go home to a safe house, and adults in assisted living facilities. It is run by a few retired teachers. "
5352,"Do I actually hate my job, or does everybody feel this way?",Do you have any hobbies or things that you look forward to outside of work? 
5353,I recently made a choice that completely ruined my career. Has anyone else done this?,"2009 Second job after college (got laid off the first one due to recession.. That's a story for another time). Was in Accounts for a major retailer. Was among the top performers.. Lots of recognition and out of line promotions. Got involved in an major screw up in clash of egos with a local manager. Was young, hot headed. I lodged a formal complaint with the HR. My time there went down hill after that. Finally had to quit. Took another job with a lower salary, took me three years and another job change to reach a comparable salary slab as my peers. People who I had  worked with in the company had amazing growth, I always wonder what would have happened if I had kept my mouth shut and my temper in control. "
5354,How do I give my 2 week notice?,"""morning Mr boss man. I need to let you know I'm putting in my notice. Its nothing personal, I really enjoy working with the people here and hope we can part on your terms because you never know. I had a really great opportunity to go to Europe for 3 months and decided to take it. ""

Or just say you need to take a leave of absence for 3 months and then you'll still have a job when you get back.... "
5355,Should I Report My Manager?,Definitely report them to HR and the higher ups. Sounds like he’s making the work environment toxic. 
5356,Should I consider a a job offer 1 month in to my current job?,"No harm in hearing him out. 

Once you've done that, take some time to think about which is the best long-term option for you.  Project forward five years and work out (as best you can) which will be best for you depending where you want to be in that time. "
5357,How do you think well on your feet and respond to unexpected questions during meetings?,"When you have a solid foundation, you dont have to plan what to say.

Or something like that, Hitler said it, he was a lot of things, smarth was one of those. "
5358,GM position at 19???,There are people in the world that do way more for their career. Why cant you? I believe you can 
5359,How to get job experience when all jobs require experience?,"One thing that can help you stand out is listing all of the books you've read that relate to your selected major. Tell me if you found that helpful.

Best of luck!  "
5360,Is 27 too old to not know what you want to do with your life?,"Ha! No. Well...yes, if you want a 30 year career doing it, but no. I'm 39, almost finished with my second master's degree and PRETTY sure I've figured it out. But maybe not, who knows? Just do stuff. It'll either be right or it won't be. Whatever you do, don't sit around asking yourself what you want to do. Years will disappear while you're standing still. At least if you try and fail you'll have a record of stuff to look back on. You might even discover something (as I did) that you would have otherwise never considered.  "
5361,"BA in Philosophy, ~5 years work experience at law firm accounting dept., what next?","Hey there, I'm very much in the same position as you are and I'm also in Chicago. I graduated with a BA in Philosophy, dedicated a year of community service and outreach through Americorps, and after my service year landed in the legal field at a personal injury firm. I've moved up to the legal department for the securities industry where I feel a lot more compensated, but feeling a little stagnant and I find this field to be dry, so I can totally relate to how you feel about law school. If  I decide to go for my Master's I prefer to choose a field that will both compensate, give me growth, and result in not having to sell my soul. I'm health driven for sure, and I have a passion for social and environmental advocacy. If it helps any at all, look into Earth Justice, legal departments in Start Up firms in the area, or like others have mentioned,  government, where you might feel more valuable doing meaningful work. Friends have encouraged me to consider computer science or data analysis for their salary and work environment, despite how costly it might be to acquire the degree. I'm currently wondering if urban development and policy would be a wise move. On my downtime I go through all of the MA programs offered at UIC, DePaul, and other schools, looking through their curriculums and tuition and Googling their career paths and salary. Hope you find clarity - I'm trying to do the same, just know you're not alone. "
5362,Has anyone recovered from a non linear career and wrong career choices?,"I'm in the same boat. 32 here and had to take many jobs just to pay the bills. I could not afford waiting for my dream job. Add up to that two career changes until I finally graduated. Now, I am in some sort of limbo where I was not even sure what I wanted to do. So I started trying many things which further dispersed my goals and makes me seem like someone who does not know what he wants. Moved to another country and took the first job I landed. Totally unrelated with my career. Also, I have a very cold personality so I am not very charismatic. I spent a lot of time trying to fix my social behaviours. Trying to be a lot more conversational than I feel comfortable and many other things. Bottom line is I keep getting rejected from HR jobs which is my major and I hold about 3 years of experience in the hr team of large multinationals. Last one ended about three 4 ago.

Finally, I am unemployed again and I decided something different. I cannot enroll in a masters degree rn, money is an issue. I seeked professional help and assessed my personality and I finally decided to accept those traits that people do not often like to admit. For example, I am not a multitasker, I am more logical than emotional, I am an excellent team player, however I kinda hate interacting too much with people. I'm shit at small talk.

What I am doing now is the following. I am studying data analytics on my own by taking online courses that I can afford. I focussed my CV on those skills that I actually feel comfortable admitting to. We are sold the idea sometimes that everyone has to be charismatic and all that stuff, but I am ready to stop trying to be someone I am not and play with my strengths. I am switching the focus of my career from HR to other departments like admin, accountings, finance, which are areas I am really good at grasping and fast. Now, most jobs I apply for I feel confident. I still apply to some hr jobs that favor my traits. I am very procedural and structure oriented instead of a more open and creative person.

I started changing my profile this week, so I will post you guys on any updates.

I do not think it is impossible to manage to get up from a scattered career after 30, but it is harder and requires a lot of effort and knowing exactly what you want. "
5363,"I got a raise and promotion, but it feels like a pay cut...Can you get a raise to a lower FTE salary than you had the previous year?","Yeah this is a failure on HR's part, that's not how this works. "
5364,Which Career is Less Stressful: Accounting or Programming?,"I'm going to rephrase the Q.  Which career is less boring, accounting or programming?  

You may think you want a less stressful job. But accounting is so stress-free I think I'd shoot myself if I had to do it day-in and day-out.  You want a bit of stress in a job to know you're alive.

Programming is the answer to what you want, hands-down. "
5365,"Hairstylists of Reddit, do you enjoy your career?","I’m 48 and looking for a career after having been a sahm for 16 years! . Thanks to those who have answered. I was thinking I would get tired of cutting hair all day, but what really interests me is doing lash extensions and microblading.  "

5369,Successful people with liberal arts degrees: What did you have to do to get a foothold in the job market?,"They probably went back to school and got a STEM degree or MBA. 

 "
5370,New employer left me hanging a day before start date. They admitted fault. I'm left hanging and jobless. What are my options?,This is America. 
5371,My CEO changed my job entirely in one day and now requires me to be out of town 2 weeks of the month. I'm a single mother and need advice. Can he do this?,"From now, keep a record of everything. 

Question every exchange or change (in paychecks, working hours etc) in writing (emails). If you have a discussion in person with your boss and he provides verbal assurance of something or outlines changes, send a follow up email summarising the discussion and your understanding of it (friendly and professional). Any requests to changes to projects, make sure your response is detailed in writing and explains your situation and why you can/cannot achieve what they have asked you to do. Keep a timeline of projects you need to complete and their due dates/when they get completed. 

And start looking for another job. Your gut is telling you something isn't right, and you are probably correct. It's hard when you've been at a company for a few years. It's comfortable, it pays well, you've put in a lot of goodwill, you want to do right by your employer and do the best job you can do. Hopefully everything will be fine going forward, but if it isn't you want to make damn sure your ducks are in a row and you have a safety net (especially seeing as you are a parent). Having a backup plan also means that your word and any ultimatum you may need to make carries more power. You know your worth. "
5372,How much credibility do employee reviews have on websites like Glassdoor or Indeed?,"Both good and bad.  I use it more for tips and minor info.  Just like any other "" review based"" format- most just piss and moan about nothing. But really depends on the company.  Didn't read anything negative about my current employer but after taking the job ( total shit show).....use at your discretio "
5373,Should I give up on finding a job that I enjoy?,a job is a job its not supposed to be fillfilling nor fun 
5374,Is it time for me to move on if acquiring a Masters isn't a valid reason to request a pay increase?,"It is unusual for an underling to be paid significantly more than his manager. Go straight to H.R. and tell them the situation and say it's unacceptable. Give them a chance to make it right. In case they don't, make sure your resume and LinkedIn profiles are updated now, so you can start your search immediately. Good luck. "
5375,How do I tell potential employer I quit my last job in a professional way?,"I’m planning to use the phrase ,”over time it just seemed as though the company was no longer looking out for my best interest, and I felt it was time to look for other opportunities” 

(Feel free to critique my answer) "
5376,"I’m a fresh high school graduate and i’m highly interested in studying Computer Science, I have absolutely no experience or knowledge in the field and I took no high level math or science classes in HS. What’s some advice to start heading in the right direction?",Find a community college program with degree upgrade options.  
5377,What do I say when asked in an interview “What about this job interests you?” when the only reason I want the job is because I will be getting paid?,Fuck it. Tell the truth. “The financial opportunity here will challenge me to be my best. There is honor in providing for your family as well as humanly possible.” 
5378,How do you turn down a promotion?,"hey.... i'm a lead therapist as well, masters degree, i was lucky to get licencsed this year, and opportunities do come along. There is a nasty pressure to get in to management in non-profit, county-funded programs, as they are designed like a corporate job, you work your way up in leadership. However I've noticed that many people are understanding of other goals, such as you can share your desire to work with people directly as a provider as opposed to managing staff.

Some of it may be how many jobs are in your area. My boss has been dangling the same carrot as they want to move on and hope I'll fill the position. Management is a lot of work!

I hope you find a smooth transition. Let me know if I can help via DM. "
5379,"What can I do today, to help better myself for my future and career?","If you want to really make the world a better place become exceptional at something.  That may require education or money.  But it will always require significantly more work and effort than you could ever imagine.  As was previously mentioned read outliers for an idea of what it takes to be hyper successful.  

Are you willing to put in the work to become exceptional at something? "
5380,How can I make better contributions during meetings?,All of the above + bring cookies 
5381,Which salary estimation site should I trust/cite when determining salary requirements?,"I was making $65k when I interviewed for my current job. They asked what I was thinking for salary and I said $80k. I was like hoooo boy that’s probably too much. It was a small step up in title but generally the same work. They ended up offering me $93k and an annual target bonus of 13% on top. Then I was like “now I can’t negotiate, they already know I would take $80k” "
5382,How can I supplement my skills to become a data analyst?,Duke University offers a specialization certificate “Excel to MySQL: Analytic Techniques for Business” on Coursera. You can get it done in 4 months and it will only cost you $250. I’m currently working on it! 
5383,What part-time jobs can house and feed a single adult?,I know some fast food allows you to bring food home 
5384,People doing what you love: how did you get to a place where you're doing what you love?,"They call it ""work"" for a reason. You arent supposed to love it. You are supposed to tolerate it in exchange for pay and do your best to earn your pay. Your life outside of work is where meaning is "

5386,Is There A Website Like This? Where Interests Are Linked To Careers?,Someone should develop one... 
5387,Do people really enjoy working? I can't decide if I should switch career completly to try to find something I might enjoy doing OR just accept that working sucks and try to find a cushy job that makes it tolerable ?!,"I really like my job.  Sometimes it's difficult or boring or stressful, but I feel like anything worth doing in life is like that sometimes.  Most mornings I am looking forward to going to work, and sometimes I stay late, not because anyone forces me to, but because it's important to me to get the job done well.

I agree with the poster above that you should find something important to you.  I work for a manufacturer, which doesn't sound that important, but we make very useful product and we charge a fair price for it.  I get to talk to customers a lot and they're usually very happy with us.  So I feel like my work is useful to society, and I'm proud of what we do.

I think you should try to find something you enjoy.  It's not going to be fun every minute of every day, but you should be able to find something that you look forward to doing every day. "
5388,Anyone else in the same boat?! Wanting to make a clean break and looking for new careers that won't break the bank or require years of extra study? Would love to hear your ideas!,"Wedding photography is competitive but needs zero training.

5389,Is it just me or was this interview really odd?,What the... Are you sure the company is legit? Sounds like a tax dodge or similar. 
5390,Is there a job that allows you to work from home?,You can do sales remotely. 
5391,"Professional level work load and expectations but paid barely above minimum wage. When is enough, enough?","Five years and you can go, it would have been fine on your resume at three years.

5392,What are professional habits every new professional should know before starting their career?,Great thread.  
5393,"Wanting to switch careers & really enjoy researching/analyzing information - other than data analyst, what are some careers/career paths I should look into?",[deleted] 
5394,"Failed one of those ""would you rather"" pre-job assessments and I meet all the preferred qualifications for the job. What now?",Sorry to hear that. Honestly best way is like an earlier guy said. Plead your case to someone who is in charge. The only way those things are overridden is by intervention. If not then sadly you'll have to move on. I know it sucks and it hurts. It's very hard not to put emotion into a position you want badly.  
5395,Is it OK to still be searching & applying for jobs even though I recently started a new one?,"I’m in a similar situation, expect it’s not the job that’s wearing me down but my supervisor. Also, I’m still technically an intern...

How many months have you worked there? I’m hoping that by the end of the internship I either get offered a job with good enough pay to tolerate her (unlikely), or she loosens up her bitchiness knowing that I’m there to stay and not a lowly intern with the lowest possible pay (close to being illegal where I am) "
5396,"I lied and it got me in a stupid career pickle, any suggestions?",Personally I would just take a screenshot of the email and Photoshop the number. 
5397,Would you take a 45% pay raise if it meant working out of state 50+ minutes away?,"I always have.

One thing to recognize is that salary increases tend to compound over your career. Each new job will do their best to base their salary offer off of your old one. So taking significant raises whenever you can is generally worth it, even with an extra hour of driving each day. "
5398,How do you stay positive during job searching?,"Sorry that you're battling a tough job search. It can be brutal. Hopefully some of these ideas can help:

* *Step away from the computer.* Take some time to rejuvenate by doing something you enjoy, whether it's baking, gardening, playing music...take a break.
* *Network.* I know it doesn't always sound like the most fun, but networking gives you an excuse to dress up and get out of the house. There's an added bonus potential of meeting someone who could connect you with your next job opportunity.
* *Celebrate all of your successes.* If you landed an interview but didn't ultimately get the job, that still means your materials were awesome enough to get you an interview. Likewise, if you set a goal to send out 10 applications per week, and you reach your goal, celebrate! Remembering to take pride in the small victories can help keep you moving. 
* *Post positive reminders.* Use phone notes, sticky notes, a whiteboard \- whatever method will grab your attention \- and inundate yourself with positive messages. Try posting inspirational quotes, short\-term goals, or pictures of loved ones to keep you motivated.

Best of luck! "

What happened, and how long did it take to get an offer?","Barely relevant, but fun story: When I was 12, I bombed an audition at my local community theatre. I had been practicing by myself so much that when we were doing group script readings and it was my turn to say a line I just kept going...and going...with every character's lines until I realized that the room got quiet and some people were stifling laughter.

Honestly, how bad will this reflect on me to my potential employer?","It took me till about 3 mo preggo to realize that I should start realizing I had what a lot of western medicine specialists call a disability. I had to start a new, second job cause the hours at my other werent always ideal. My new employer, I didnt tell her till bout a month into the gig cause a) i wanted them to see I was capable of doing my job (im a server/bartender) and b) cause I was afraid of ehat theyd think of me, going further into the job come recovery time off. Well, when I told the owner she was sooo supportive and told me anything I need to take. Which is a load off.  
 
You ARE special needs, technically, and an employer doesnt get to dictate your choices on the job, luckily. Just be aware, as Im sure you are, of the laws regarding leave in your state. "
5404,"Graduating soon, what can I do to prepare for future employment, and can my current job help?","Personally, I think a business degree isn’t all that good, especially considering other majors in the business school. I wouldn’t think it’s “worthless” though. Since you already have work experience that’s going to matter more and your degree’s area of study will matter a bit less. I’d just start applying to jobs now, polish up your resume (including the fact that you’ll be graduating in 2020 ofc) and try to get a job lined up before you graduate. You’ll be in much better shape. 

Your job duties look really good dude. I honestly think you’ll do well (: "

5406,How can I pick a career and start over?,"Your marketable skills include: trilungual, desire to improve yourself, and your probably a pretty nice person so likeability, easy to work with. 

&#x200B;

The fact that you have never had a full time job because of your health issue should be addressed first. How are you going to study full time or focus full time if you can't even get out of bed on those bad days? 

&#x200B;

We all go through depression. It's nothing special. Sometimes it lasts a day or a week or years but it's never permanent (incoming hate replies, downvotes) I believe we can change our brains through meditation and exercise. 

&#x200B;

My advice would be start feeling better more than you feel bad and then things will naturally fall into place. It won't be easy but if you are persistent and really determined, you can change for the life you want! "
5407,How often are you expected to work outside of working hours?,"I'm a dev and if necessary I'm required to work outside work hours whenever I'm on-call. Otherwise I always do my best to work only at the office. But the marketing and biz-dev team are called in on Saturdays for ""productivity sessions"". IMO as long as you're being paid for the extra hours or you want to do it, asking employees to work outside the office is not cool.

Some countries in Europe even have laws against it. You need time away from the office, with your family or for your hobbies etc.  "
5408,How do I find a career I love?,You don’t  
5409,What is best way to interview for a new job if you are working 9-5 and don’t want to call out sick?,"Sack up and call out sick or take a vacation day.

You want to put your best foot forward to an interview that includes looking your best, so unless you wear a suit to work everyday youre not going to stop somewhere to change... and get all nice looking "
5410,How do you know when you’ve nailed a job interview?,"At my current job, I asked in the interview what the role entails and was told 'you will be case managing your files' and it was as though I was in the job already. When I went into detail about the applicable legislation, they also cut me off because they knew I researched the shit out of the role. I failed at a basic question but they forgave me after I barraged them with questions and we spent 45mins in the interview. Most people spend 15mins in a generalised interview. 

The last time I interviewed at a temp job, I explained to a director how my experiences made me realise how important OHS is and how accidents and injuries can impact people and how proud I was to be apart of major projects. She smiled and thanked me and I knew I had the job then  "

5412,Will turning down a position after an interview hurt my chances of being hired if I apply again in the future?,"I think thats up to the hiring manager. I would not rehire out of principle, unless you are really, really valuable (but I know managers who does try to pull you back). But if that's the case I'd also make sure you get paid more...

Also, the comments about never ever accepting a match within the company is too extreme I think. Most managers at large companies are not idiots, they understand some employees are underpaid or can be paid more, it does not really mean I will hold it against you if you stayed, in fact you may get more concessions for loyalty (moving to a group you want, taking on more responsibilities, growth, remote etc). I understand concerns about reprisal, but depending on the industry/state you work in this is actually very dangerous for the company as it leads to expensive and hard to win lawsuits. 

It's unfortunately never black and white and has alot to do with your dynamics with your manager, what kind of a person he is and what kind of culture the company has.  "

I agree with most every comment that people have put this far. There seems to be more and more hoops to jump to get a job too - my aunties, uncles, and parent did grade school essentially and now to get their exact job you need at least a BA plus additional education. It’s crazy to think about. "

5424,"I'm 31(M) and need a career change ASAP, but what to do?","This may not feel good to hear but if you are regularly over 45-50 hours that is your fault, not your company's fault. Simply stop doing it. If they fire you, fine. But they probably won't. 

If people 'shit' on your for things that aren't your fault regularly, again this is some you can strongly influence. If it happened once that is different. If it happens regularly you have trained them to know you will take it.  Instead consider this. Next time a person starts to 'shit' on you for something that isn't in your control, say, ""I understand you are frustrated. But speaking to me in an accusatory tone about something outside of my control isn't OK. I'm going to step out for a few minutes to let things (you and them) cool off.  When I come back, I'll be ready to listen to solutions that involve me if that is helpful. See you in a few minutes."" Then leave for at least 5 min. Leave the building and take a walk.  When people are agitated, they struggle to listen. When you come back, don't rehash. Ask a question about a solution. 

This type of 'training' of difficult people will be needed regardless of field or company. But the problems you describe have nothing specific to software except the working from home part.

Discretion has its uses, even with people and organizations you really respect or feel close to. You have to look out for yourself before you look out for anybody else, and when those things might potentially become mutually exclusive in any particular situation, now you know the potential cost of not choosing to look out for yourself, even though you have to override your noble desire to look out for them, too.

5442,Can I accept an offer with the intent to leave if I find something better?,"Jeez. The comments here surprise me. I would weigh whether the first opportunity is one you would feel happy with and would meet your goals and make the decision independently of the second. And then not look back. 

It’s not about whether some companies screw employees or about the falsity of loyalty. Its about just being a professional. 

Also, depending on the industry, it’s a small world. I saw a colleague with an open req get an application from someone who played games during a previous job negotiation at a previous company. (The original slot wasn’t that guy’s position — just a colleague but he remembered the name and story). Guy didn’t even get an interview even though he was on the top of the pile.

Or do you mean you don’t want to code simple repetitive things and be more focused on designing and architecture?

Seems like you want the latter. What you need is first, more years of experience. No ones gonna let you be the architect of anything if you haven’t paid your dues. Architects I know live and breathe frameworks and languages better than I understand my mother tongue. This only comes from more than a decade of coding.


Second, you gotta move away from small-medium companies that all have the same old deal, some backend framework , some frontend framework, same database, same issues, same features, etc... and move onto bigger companies (FAANG companies for example) it doesn’t have to be one of those companies with super cutthroat hiring practices, but it’s gotta be a big one. These companies you get to shine and move up to the ladder of implementing, to design, to architect. The problems these companies face are vast and truly endless, and the ladder to climb never ends, so you’ll be able to find your niche within they company.

Obviously you gotta study up for the interviews. These big companies just love their leetcode style interviews and that’s not gonna change anytime soon.

Go see a financial advisor, or debt consolidator. You need to stop the leak before you drown. 

I suspect one of the reasons you're trying to find a new career is you're probably so unhappy and stressed out by your financial situation that you think some perfect job is going to come fix everything, but that's simply not the case.

>I feel stifled by academic writing. I hate not being able to have original thoughts or be able to bring my clinic experience into my writing.

This sounds like the core of your issue.  And it's the core of most PhD issues, you are by no means alone.  The question is does your school have a solid writing center that can help you with this.  They should and you should leverage them heavily.  And if you haven't been sending drafts in or peppering your professors with questions now is likely the time to start.

Even if you have to retake the course you can indeed recover from this.  Especially with a supportive advisor and chair.  You'll probably also want to put feelers out early for who will eventually be your primary dissertation support to find someone you can work with who can help with that core academic writing challenge.

I've had several students who had trouble taking off their ""advocate"" hat when writing.  You can do it. Academic writing is cold and detached.  And when you master it the skill can make all of your other writing that much stronger especially the type of writing where you can leverage your clinical experience and original thoughts. "

You're cheating (asking teachers for a grade you didn't deserve with a sob story) and that affects everyone that isn't a cheater in a negative way. If you cheat your way into higher grades, that means that someone else that actually better than you will end up not getting the spot.

5491,Academic Probation after 2 Semesters in grad school. Need Help,"I would first recommend looking into any resources your school has to help you continue adjusting. This could include campus counseling services, international student services, graduate student government, etc. They will be best able to help you navigate things at your specific school. I would also make sure you have a support network in place. This is an easy thing to forget about, but not having/using it can make the situation feel even more seeious when you can't talk about.

Next, take a moment to step back and be proud of yourself. After a rocky start, you had an amazing second semester. That is important and should be acknowledged. It is also an indication of your ability to continue succeeding in your program. 

I would personally schedule a meeting with the director of grad studies for your department. Work with then to develop a plan / road map for the upcoming year. Make sure you understand what probation means for you and continuing in the program. Many schools have very black and white cutoffs for these things, the are often from the university level rather than the department. This does not mean that faculty in your department think that you are not capable or that there is no hope. 

I've found it's easy to get overwhelmed with the big picture, and that breaking it down into smaller chunks helps me feel optimistic and motivated. et smaller objectives to help you reach your larger goals. For example, if you're feeling overwhelmed about finding an advisor, first, spe d some time researching who might be a good fit. Then schedule a meeting to connect with them more. Etc. "

5502,PhD vs Masters in Biostatistics,"So I didn't read all of the old thread, but there's a lot of advice and opinions I disagree with a bit. As a frame of reference, I applied to statistics and biostatistics programs in the US this past fall (you can see my results in my post history) and I'll be joining a PhD program this fall. 

First, a few things about stats grad school in the US. Most PhD programs in the US allow you to Master out if you finish the first two years (all of the programs I visited had this option). Statistics and biostatistics PhD programs aren't that different (at least in the US). The main difference is that stats programs tend to be a bit more theoretical. You don't need a stats MS to be competitive for a stats PhD. A good number of successful applicants haven't taken any stats classes (I only took two). 

Second, an answer to your question. The biggest parts of a stats or biostats PhD application are letters of rec and math grades. Research experience isn't prioritized as much since undergrads usually don't do real stats research. That's not to say don't do research; it's a great  way to get great letters and learn about the field. With respect to math grades, competitive applicants usually have mostly A's in math classes. Multivariable calc, linear algebra, and real analysis are pre-reqs for most stats PhDs. Good grades in pure math classes make you more competitive. If you'd like to see some applicant profiles, look at the Mathematics and Statistics section of GradCafe. Just keep in mind that you shouldn't compare yourself too much.

This information comes from stats professors I've talked to, GradCafe, and my personal experience. I hope it helps! "
5503,Your Experience with a Double Major or Double Degree?,"Everyone that I know who has pursued two graduate degrees concurrently did so as part of an established dual-degree program, where there were established paths and advising for pursuing both degrees simultaneously.

The concept of a double major or major-minor at the graduate level seems to be a school-specific and not particularly widespread practice. I imagine a hiring manager who was unfamiliar with the program would just assume that this represents a ""track"" within a degree program, but honestly would just mostly care about what skills you are brining to the table. "
5504,is it “normal” to stay in classes past your program end/graduation just to complete certificates?,
5505,Graduate Course Prereqs,"Depends on the program, I met the prerequisites for the PhD program itself but not some prerequisites for some core courses, isn’t that lovely? 

In the end I got by the classes with some genuine struggle, had to retake an alternative class and now, no one really cares and the classes are done. Some dark times but hey I’m preparing to advance to candidacy soon so there is light at the end of that tunnel. 

Not all programs are like this, but some sadly do exist. "
5506,Getting a masters degree online and abroad? International,"The Open University in the UK is fabulous. I've never looked at fees for students abroad, but here in the UK would be about 9k total depending on your subject. Very rigorous and considered tougher than a brick uni. Been doing it longer than any other uni as well. "
5507,The Teacher has put no work into the class (Macro-economics),"Welcome to grad school? Seems odd for an econ class, but grad classes typically have a lot of reading. If you cant handle 300 pages a week, are you really ready for grad school? 

Also, you likely have a professor, not a teacher. Grow up a little. "
5508,10 Credit Hours vs 13 Credit Hours,"Is the 10 credit hours including your research credits? It depends on the classes, but I would strive for 1-3 classes/semester in grad school. I almost always did 2 classes per semester (not including required seminars or 1 credit classes) but then would have 6-9 research credits so the total would be around 12-15 credits for the semester. This was perfectly doable and standard. "
5509,First semester as a TA - I am terrible at it. Rant/Advice needed!,Almost everyone's first time teaching is going to be a hot mess. It's fine. You're not ruining any students' lives. You'll get exponentially better every time you teach. Does your university have a department that supports teaching? (It's called the Teaching & Learning Center where I am). They often have workshops and supports for grad students. 
5510,How do Theses actually work?,"I did an honours thesis in my undergrad (not the same as grad school though I think it's similar enough, but within a shorter time frame - i.e. I did mine in basically 6-ish months for my BA)

**Supervisor/Advisor:** The person whose name I also put on my ethics forms (which you often have to do, as you're still just a student). My supervisor was also the person I met with every 1-2 weeks to discuss ideas, progress, directions for compiling stats and writing the actual paper...etc. I found that to be an invaluable resource I didn't think of. I don't think I would've gotten the final grad I did without a supervisor with years more experience than me. It is possible for supervisors to advise more than one student at once, but I guess it also depends on the faculty size and the faculty itself.

*\*My thesis was in the humanities-social sciences, if that helps. I know in STEM there's stuff about 1st or 2nd author, that sort of thing, but I never experienced that. I just wrote my thesis and presented it via Zoom-conference*

**Topic:** I picked my topic a few months before I submitted my ethics proposal (let's say I picked my supervisor in March, and had finalized my topic in September, when the school year began). My topic proposal was very informally presented to my supervisor, who gave me tips about how to proceed. 

**Originality:** Yeah, you're right, no one has absolutely original research, but there are ways to make it your own. Say there's a load of research on autistic children's reading capabilities via PET scans...but what if you gave your topic a twist and said ""let me look at reading capabilities in bilingual autistic children via fMRI"". Honestly, that way, you have literature to draw from to figure out if you're on the right track - which will help a lot with the references and background information sections of a thesis paper. "
5511,What do you do all day?,"Back when I was enrolled and doing research full time, if you averaged out a lot of my days, it would look something like...

- Wake up about 9

- Remote log on to my computational cluster and check results from previous day, start new ones if necessary, download results, parse and analyze them. This would take about 90 minutes-3 hours depending on what the results themselves were. Send results to prof for his projects.

- If I have a reason to, get on the bus to go to campus 

- Continue desperately trying to find a paper relevant to the thing I was trying to make into my dissertation project for a few hours before giving up

- Read papers that I know aren't really relevant, but I don't know what else to do

- Work on similarly pointless lit review

- ???

- ¿¿¿

- Try and find advisor to get advice, but he isn't in his office or answering emails 99% of the time

- ¿?¿? 

- give up on getting anything else done by about 3 or 4 (or later if I had to teach that day) and just stop

- Scroll through some job applications and work on skills practice for the job search that I know will be coming sooner than expected...

- Go home and make a really nice dinner for myself because that makes me feel like I actually did something that day

- Strategy video games or RPGs until like 1-2 AM

- repeat

5512,Custom degree,"You're referring to ""interdisciplinary studies"" degrees were you make your own degree and the school approves it. Lot of schools do this "
5513,Historiography... I'm kind of confused.,"To make sure you have a good understanding of each approach, try first summarizing each in a sentence. Then, under each summary, add bullet point details that are important for elaborating. To really impress your prof (and this will likely be required in your papers at some point anyway), be sure to note how each school of thought responds to the others. Imagine Ranke and Braudel have a verbal battle to obscurity; how would each take the other down? Conversely, also note when schools agree on a certain value. Historiography in the Twentieth Century by Iggers was very helpful for this.

I can't tell you how to best go about this, since it's your project, but based on the event you chose, I don't get the sense that the approaches you chose will be easy/a good match--I do think it's possible, though. I bet Annales would work well: place this singular event in the context of varying lengths of time. Feel free to DM if you have specific questions about the varying schools of thought. "
5514,Pursuing a MPH,Health Policy and Management can be different pursuits.  Have you heard of an MHA degree?  What field are you looking to get into?  I chose the Masters in Healthcare Admin because I wanted to be a clinical manager.

5516,Finally completed my coursework,Congrats. Well deserved :) 
5517,Best self learning sources for academic writing for grad students?,"The only real way to get better at writing, like anything else, is to practice. You can read all the helpful hints and tips you want, but writing is a mental gymnastics that you’ve got to practice performing. Constantly revisit and revise your document. "
5518,"To those who used tablets to take down “handwritten notes”, what laptop/tablet did you use and did it help?","iPad Air with pencil and PDF expert. Yes it did help for me, but I use it to annotate and read PDFs - not to study or take notes. I don't take notes so can't really give advice as far as they're concerned. "
5519,I'd like to hear about positive PhD experiences for a change,"It's rarely as simple as ""positive"" or ""negative"". A PhD lasts long enough that most people who do one will probably have at least one crappy period at some point during the process.

But overall, now that I'm close to graduating, I am extremely glad that I decided to do a PhD. If a time traveler gave me a chance to talk to my past self I would definitely tell past-me that the PhD was a good move and she should go for it.

This is *despite* the fact that there have been several points during the PhD process that led to me crying and wondering why the hell I had ever thought grad school was a good idea. Those crappy moments passed, and when I am not in the middle of one, I can see that (for me) grad school was worth it despite the bad parts, and that overall I am very glad I decided to do it. "
5520,Thesis Based or Course Based?,"As a rule of thumb, I think thesis based is better for STEM, plus you have a better likelihood of getting fund. I would ask some other professional engineers/hiring managers what they prefer though - there way even be a good subreddit to ask for career advice in your industry. "
5521,[ADVICE] What should I expect from an MPH?,"You're committed to starting a professional degree in a few months, but you're coming here for ideas about the profession related to said degree? How does that work? "

5523,Planning my PhD,"You actually made me laugh out loud at the idea of planning 4 years of a PhD. I wonder if anyone has ever penned a plan that remotely resembled reality. Goals are good, but a Gantt chart is a little optimistic at this point. "
5524,Advice on Feeling Inadequate?,"MS student here, in fact the only MS student in my group (rest are PhDs). There's nothing wrong with an MS rather than PhD. IMO MS is a very good choice because you can learn some great things and do some research, and if you decide a PhD is not for you then you can finish and do something else somewhat easily. First thing to understand is imposter syndrome seems practically to be a requirement for being a grad student. Seriously, everybody has it. If your lab group is not full of rude, terrible people they will not look down on you for not being as good as they are. You are certainly not going to be as good as they are at the beginning because you're just starting, that just makes sense. I struggled with this as well, and here's what helped me. Say you are the worst graduate student in the group. Who cares? Use this time and this experience to improve yourself and work on something you're interested in. You got admitted, which means that the people who's job it is to decide if someone will be a good fit, decided you would be a good fit. You demonstrated that you have the required background and ability, but grad school is more of an exercise in grit than intelligence. What's the worst case scenario? You go and you are so bad that they kick you out? You go and your lab group is really mean and sucks and you decide to drop out? (I think both are very unlikely). The alternative is to quit before trying, and that's no way to live my dude. If you're excited for the program, and you work hard, and don't put crazy amounts of pressure on yourself, you'll be fine. "
5525,American vs European PhD research programs,"I can’t make a comment on American vs European phds, as I’m from Europe and have always lived in Europe. I do find the American system odd though. The point of a PhD is to do your own research with some guidance to prepare you for independent research, what’s the purpose of courses and exams? Also I did enough exams during my undergraduate xD

There is even some variation between PhD programs in Europe too. I have one friend who had to take some courses with exams at the end in his first year. Whereas I only have two courses with no exams, I just have to turn up to the seminar, and only in my first year. After my first year it’s all just research work.

Also 5 years is a long time, is that a combined masters+PhD? "
5526,Feels like I'm drowning and I don't know what to do,"You are prioritizing the right things here. Your health and well-being is most important - everything else is secondary. If you need an extension, ask for it, and don't feel bad. You are not alone in your graduate school struggles. "
5527,Masters in molecular biology or environmental sustainability?,"There's definite scope for molecular stuff in environmental work. People are increasingly using eDNA, for example, in monitoring and conservation efforts. However, if you ""feel like you would like more a job that doesn’t have you sitting in a lab for hours"" then the molecular side definitely isn't for you! It's might be that straight forward. 

If you want to do environmental field work you're going to be heading down more of an ecology route, to be honest. That could have molecular work involved, but would be less intense than a strict molecular biology lab. 

I don't know too much about environmental sustainability but I know a lot of people in conservation and the bulk of that work is office-based as the crux of it happens through policy change or implementation. 

Ultimately they seem be quite disparate subject and I don't know how much true crossover you'd go. As such, you're be compromising in one way or the other. "
5528,"""Don't just tell me your TA sucked - name them, and tell us how they sucked!""","> we spent up to 50 hours per week on just work for this course.

How do you even do that? Did you still need to setup the course from scratch lol? Most TA work is having working sessions (typically 4-6 hours / week) and then providing some support emails which take like 2-3 hours typically and grading (this depends on what / how much you need to grade, usually its like ~20-40 hours). "
5529,Should I get this this third master degree?,"MBAs are of questionable value anyway, and the best programmes tend to recommend that you have a few years experience under your belt (and if an MBA is really worth your time your employer will tend to be willing to pay for it). And for an MBA where you do it really really matters. "
5530,I won a teaching award!!,Good job 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 we need the positivity sometimes !!! 
5531,Do history masters do tests and exams?,"Just finished my courses(about to write a thesis!) and I only had one class with quizzes, but the quizzes were only quizzes in a loose sense. Three times throughout the course we had to answer three short essay questions about the readings we did. Most of the questions were directly about the readings, connecting the readings to each other or to the broader field of history, or connecting the readings to our own projects. 

In my experience, most grad school history classes involve a lot of reading(a book a week) and a thorough weekly discussion. You will also have to write a historiography or research paper at the end. This paper might be pretty hefty, but it might not be. You might have to write a book review or two. You might need to lead some of the weekly discussions. You might also need to write some kind of precis about the weekly readings. "
5532,Getting into classes outside of your program?,"It could be as simple as the professor had had a bad experience with non majors. They may worry you lack the qualifications or won't take it seriously. From an engineering perspective, I would be hard pressed to allow a mechanical engineer MS take any grad level electrical engineering circuits or signals courses. Despite being adjacent fields, the crossover in those subfields is nil. "
5533,Should I continue with my SV?,"This kind of ""supervising"" behavior is unfortunately more common than anybody would like, but it's generally not so normalized that you should *have* to put up with this behavior. 

If you continue in the field, I would recommend looking into picking a different advisor, and talking to other students about advising styles before committing to anything. This is a common enough choice such that it shouldn't ruffle too many feathers. "
5534,Assistantships?,"This is highly dependent on your program and university. Some universities have a clearinghouse off positions, others send all positions within the department, others offer them directly to students, others you need to reach out to the specific researchers. I’d recommend reaching out to your advisor or the department or program chair and see the protocol for you specific department! "
5535,Academic anxiety impacting performance,"The best way to prevent the triggers is to get very good at developing and adhering to schedules. This avoids the stress of waiting until the last moment, and if you document your progress on your schedule, it can be very reassuring to get a single-glance dose of reassurance that you're doing okay. "
5536,Master’s programs?,"In general, I don't think psychology is a lucrative career. Are you looking for lucrative or are you looking for something that uses certain skills? Maybe check with r/findapath "
5537,For those who are in doctoral programs: was there hesitation/fear or just excitement?,"If you're feeling so ambivalent about it, then don't go. Grad school is gloomy for many reasons, and a big part of making it through involves being able to build for yourself a support network: friends, colleagues, acquaintances, activities unrelated the academia... you know, a life. It's okay to feel hesitation and fear, it's a scary decision, but come on: you're not enlisting in the army and signing over 5 years of your life, it's just grad school, and you can always drop out or even transfer programs halfway through. I personally know 4 people who transferred between schools, and another 3 that transferred between departments/PhD programs within the same school I attend now. It's more flexible than you think it is. 

Still from how you worded this post, it seems as if you're asking for permission to turn down the offer-- I grant you this permission. You're not crazy about it, and it will be incredibly grueling: the idea that you can just toil away at your PhD without a social life for half a decade is bonkers. 

If you want to be sneaky and hedge your bets, ask them for a deferred admission bc of the covid. Reapply next year to other programs, and if you get in nowhere, then you'll at least have this school. 

This whole idea that the application market will be crammed next time around-- I see the argument for that, but it's clear that this is just empty speculation. In my experience and from what I've learned over the last couple years, grad school admissions are a crap shoot and are mostly based on luck. You can be rejected from a program, and then accepted by a far stronger program a year later. There are too many factors to be able to predict this with any sense of certainty. So if you're not crazy about it, try your luck again. "

"
5541,MPH Canadian Graduate Programs,"One of my friend who did PH master in a Montreal told me it was not worth it : the GPA requirement is ridiculous (3.7), the classes are huge, a lot of coursework is online and he didn’t felt he got what he paid for. He got out of the program with a master diploma without real knowledge since he only read scientific journals and had  multiple choices questions in his exams. He told me it was not worth it. He has a fancy diploma with sexy name on it, and that’s it. He continued to PhD in PH, where he got what he was looking for. Having know, he would have done something else for master.

I looked at public health in Montreal too, but did not met the GPA requirement (3.2) I Went in a related field where I could also work in health, mortality and aging instead. "
5542,Grad school for Neural network science,"Since you are doing related research already, the best avenues are:

1. Find recent papers in specific research areas you want to work on. Which professors are running the research, and what grad programs do they take students from?
2. Ask your research advisor what the top or best-fit programs are for you specific interests. "
5543,How to make your professors notice/remember you?,"Try going to office hours, this will help them remember your face and try to remember your name.   If you're not able to go to office hours (such as in a situation like this). You can try to ask questions if there are zoom office hours or via email. 

Im currently a professor, students also stand out if they choose to do presentations first or apply to a competition that is optional where I can give additional guidance and there are more opportunities to interact. "

I thought I should give you some information regarding my coming to your country. Sentence about Visa status. Sentence about any other important information, like when you are arriving and such. Sentence asking any questions you have. I will be available by email all summer if you have any questions for me."" 

Put something like that in email format and you're good to go. Assuming your adviser's not an ass they'd probably like to hear from you. You're still several months out, so I wouldn't worry about trying to hammer out any true details, just a nice quick update would probably be pleasant to recieve. Plus by emailing them it opens up a line of communication. "

5550,"First Qualifying Exam This Next Week. Nervous, but Might Get Masters!","Good luck on your quals!! I'm also the first in my family to get a college degree, let alone go on to a phd. I understand how frusterating it can be when they don't ""get it,"" and how big of a milestone this is. 

On to your questions.. As side note, I'm a 4th yr in a psych phd so my responses reflect that and not an English phd. 

I guess I felt a little different when I got the MA, but still being in the rode to a phd made it a little less exciting. It felt really good that DAY when I defended my MA thesis and felt like I accomplished something big. Now I'm just dreaming of being done (which, cross your fingers, I will be in a year or two still).

I've been called ""professor"" by students but no, I am a mere TA that occaisionally has to do more than grading depending on what class I teach for. There's an option in my program to teach your own course as lead instructor but I haven't gone for that yet (too focused on the research). "
5551,Looking for Advisor for a first year CS PhD student,"Since you’ve already been accepted, I think it would be worth simply introducing yourself over email and mentioning that you would love to do a Zoom call sometime to acquaint yourselves. You might want to mention what you’re interested in, something you find interesting in their research, and that you’re excited to join the program. I went through a similar process where I had to find a supervisor after joining the school and a lot of it does happen organically once you’re there, but it’s good to be on their radar. I think it would be a mistake to be super formal as if you’re still applying to the program since you’re already essentially colleagues. (That’s just my opinion, though.) "

If there are problems down the road because of it (doubt it) you can always present the email as evidence. "
5555,Will I be in trouble for allowing my students to submit assignments after the deadlines have passed?,"Depending on your course policy, you might just be able to provide this as an extra credit option, but obviously with a limit (Such as one assignment can be submitted/resubmitted etc). "
5556,Question about conferences and such,"Your advisor of all people should know what the top tier venues for your research space are. A good strategy is to find the top authors/groups in your concept-sphere, people who have job titles in academia that you want, and see where they invest their energy in publishing.  Another way is by looking up venues in your space by impact factor.

5565,What should I expect from my committee members?,"First year seems early to be setting up a committee. Try to find an adviser first. This would be a professor that has similar research as you and who you can trust for feedback. In many schools they have no official obligations to you, but are there for you to ask all the questions you mentioned. They will help you set up a committee once you have settled on a research topic. All faculty know what the obligations of being on a committee are. You should not explain it to them or put demands on them. 

&#x200B;

Also, just so you are aware, your committee will do almost nothing for you. They will attend your proposal and defense. If you are lucky they will read through your paper. Only one or two members on your committee will do the 'heavy lifting' "
5566,How does it work when you retake pre-reqs?,You should check your faculty rules for undergrad studies. They are on the website of your university. These rules change from faculty to faculty so it’s hard to tell what’s specific for you.

Right now I’d like to do my MPH in Epi and then pursue a PhD in either Microbiology or Virology.

I think it might help you to look at research or publications you find interesting, and look up the contributors to see what backgrounds they have. If they’re doing research that you could see yourself doing, then you could certainly get there with whatever degree(s) are common with them.

What I'm not sure is why are you enquiring to an Erasmus office and if this advice is sound or if there's a misunderstanding there. Are your referring to the university or the EACEA for funding under an Erasmus scheme/fellowship?

What you should do first is getting info on the PhD programs you're interested in. Their pages should list all the requirements, including the type of Masters needed for a specific Doctorate if applicable. "
5597,I’m going to attempt to solely use my iPad,"I assume you are in a field where a laptop isn't needed day-to-day and school computers are easily available as needed. However, I imagine that reducing yourself to just an iPad might still introduce inconveniences. 

Personally, I really rely on having multiple displays while I work. I regularly have my laptop, external monitor, and iPad mini out and displaying different things. While newer iPads do have the split screen function, not all apps will allow it -- a unfortunate example currently is Zoom. I encourage you to consider what kind of functionalities you are going to need at the same time, and if your iPad if going to be able to support that, especially since printing is going to be a bit harder.

In terms of things to make your iPad work for you better -- if you are going to use an Apple Pencil or other firm-tipped stylus, you should purchase a ""paper-like"" or matte screen protector. It increases friction for a more normal writing experience and also reduces glare. "

Procrastinators usually perform in ""sprints"" where they crunch before a deadline. That is not an effective strategy long-term. You need to learn to do it every (work) day.

Behaviorism is pretty useful here. Just like you were trained to poop in the toilet instead of in your pants and perhaps trained to brush your teeth, wash your hands etc. you can train yourself to do work. Consistency and establishing a routine is key. It's a lot easier to just stick to a daily routine than try to come up with some new behavior.

I went to the army and we woke up at 06:00 every morning, had 10 minutes to put some clothes on, use the toilet and be ready to move out for food. First week was chaotic and sucked, 11 months later we'd have time to chat and mess around and browse reddit on our phones. Things like making your bed, going to eat at specific times, cleaning your barracks every day, cleaning your gun etc. just became habits that you did and didn't feel terrible anymore. To the new recruits we seemed like gods of war because we could put up a tent in 15 minutes, get a fire going and fall asleep on a pile of logs and branches (better than cold uneven ground). It's just habit and having done it 100 times before.

Years later and I can't wake up at 06:00 to save my life, even a little bit of pressure from a hurry turns the whole morning into a chaotic mess and I haven't made my bed for a long time and I clean my apartment maybe once in a few months. It would feel overwhelmingly difficult to start making my bed every morning and cleaning my apartment every day but when it was part of your daily routine, it didn't even feel like a chore. "
5606,"What has been your experience getting a Master’s degree funded, especially if the Master’s degree is required? What list is out there for list external funding programs for East Asian Studies?","Terminal master's are rarely, if ever, funded. For STEM fields the only potentials are really NSF research grants and college-specific. Most PhDs are funded, across the board. Apply for PhDs and ""master-out"", if that's your goal. "
5607,Medical & mental health academic accommodations in grad school,"You should meet with your schools disability center and see what they suggest. When you get accommodations, I believe they fall under the ADA - so your school really does have to work with you to a reasonable extent. IIRC, you also don’t have to disclose the reason for accommodations to your professor, just the disability office. Your school center should have some good suggestions of what accommodations are common and/or most helpful. 

Remember, just because you are granted accommodations doesn’t mean you have to use them every time. From my understanding, it’s better to have accommodations in place now that you don’t have to invoke than to need them and have to go through the whole process again. 

I haven’t had accommodations myself, but I had many undergraduates in my class who did and the whole process seemed to go well. Common accommodations were extended time on exams, excused absences, and flexible assignment dates. The key is to always be in contact with your professor. If you need extra time, let them know as far ahead as you can. If you don’t communicate, then frustration on both sides can easily build. "

5609,Suggestions for MS in Atmospheric Sciences,"I will be starting an M.S. in Atmospheric Sciences/Meteorology in the fall, and I applied for several programs this cycle, and ultimately received and accepted an offer from my dream school. PM if you have any questions! "
5610,How many of you are in grad school for a subject you didn't study in undergrad? What was the transition like?,"I went from a BS and MS in Immunology to a PhD in Biomedical Informatics. I always leaned a bit on the analytical side of science so it wasn't too jarring, but it was frustrating that I couldn't understand a lot of the mathematical and computational topics that the Computer Science majors new intuitively. It was also expected that they not know biology but us biologists were expected to know some computer science. Regardless, now in my 4th year and the top student in the program, it just meant I had to learn a lot of things on my own. "
5611,Any good graduate programs in probability theory?,"I'm... a little confused about what you consider ""statistics"" to be. It is definitely not just -- or even mostly -- data analysis.

Probability theory is an integral component of statistical research, and there will certainly be probability theorists in any strong statistics department. Many math departments also have faculty doing research in probability theory. However, probability isn't so broad or popular a field that it would be sensible to, for example, offer a full master's degree in just probability.

In terms for how to proceed, *not all programs are created equal* and you are just going to work harder to figure out what will work for you. Since you are already taking relevant classes, your professor(s) in the field can offer advice. Some departments are starting to offer separate statistics and data science degrees, partly so that the ""statistics"" degree can remain more theory-oriented -- so, in a way, it could be helpful to look at which schools do offer a data science degree.  

Ultimately, if you're much more interested in and committed to theory, it may make more sense to apply directly to PhD programs instead. Master's degrees are meant to be more practical. "
5612,Those who went to grad school after several years out of academia - your experiences?,"I’m 33 and worked in study abroad and international admissions for nearly 12 years. I miss the money, but honestly I wasn’t enjoying my job. I had planned on getting my MEd and certification, but I’m loving the research side way more than the teaching. Looking to apply to a PhD program next semester. I’m way more disciplined now, and even the recent grads on my program don’t feel like they’re way beyond my peer group. "
5613,Humanities: how do you come up with original questions/paper topics?,"&#x200B;

>How do you come up with good questions in the humanities and move forward with confidence that you can write a \~20 page paper on it without summarizing someone else’s thoughts for >half of it?

&#x200B;

A good way to start here is to not just summarize. Take multiple authors and put them in dialogue with each other - what does author A say, and how does author B's point contradict that or strengthen the argument? Comparing and contrasting the work of different authors is a helpful way to figure out the shortcomings in the overall body of work as well, and can help identify a problem with the literature that you can try to solve with your work.

I also agree with the previous posts and don't think they necessarily contradict each other - go into the research and find what about it excites you, then explore the work done in that niche and work out the problems with the existing work.

The problem isn't not having foundational knowledge (I switched from a social science during undergrad to the humanities in postgrad - I had absolutely NO foundational knowledge but could still formulate research questions in the new field) but more about confidence. It takes some gut to say that another author, especially an established one, is doing something in a manner that could be done better, or that experts in the field are missing certain connections, or whatever -- but every single author is just a human being with limitations, and sometimes we get so stuck in our pattern of thinking that we forget some very obvious connections elsewhere. If you keep thinking about it as a shortage of knowledge, you just end up in a loop where you never feel like you know enough. There's always more to learn! The key is to learn as you go while doing research, not to learn first and do the research later :) "
5614,MFA in Industrial Design - Worth it?,"I would never recommend someone to pay for an MFA like the one I am in (fine arts), but something like design might have a better return on investment. I would research into jobs and speak with people who have that degree and then decide. Or just look at funded schools like I did—free tuition plus a stipend in exchange for gaining teaching experience is a sweet deal. "
5615,Retaking courses online,"I used Straighterline and did 4 courses in a month for like $300.  I was just knocking out Gen Ed's that went on my undergrad transcript, not replacing classes.  I had a good experience with them, FWIW.

Straigherline gives ACE credits, so you should be able to find some guidance on how your school handles those pretty readily in the Alternative or Transfer credit part of the school catalogue. "
5616,"Thinking about pivoting and changing fields for my PhD, is this a good idea?",Have you considered looking at EdD programs? 
5617,Random question: Can you take undergraduate courses after completing your masters?,"I work in registration, records, and enrollment at a medium sized regional comprehensive, Masters granting institution.

We allow post baccalaureate students to take courses as they please. Often cost and funding are an issue - we charge full-undergraduate rate to those students and there is limited federal and institutional aid for them.

There are some schools that limit post-bac students. The tier-one, flagship research institution in my state requires post-bac students to submit a letter and plan to the admissions office.

Tl;dr: Ask the university you'd like to take classes at what their policy may be, if anything. "
5618,How do you know a doctorate program is right for you?,"My brother is getting a PhD in psych from UChicago right now. With his TA position and getting paid for his research he’s actually netting a profit. He’s got a few roommates too so rent is cheap. He even paid off his new car in under a year.

Meanwhile I’m over here getting my Master’s basically living off the government making a $200/wk stipend from my RA position. "

5621,Does the writing get easier? Writing resources?,"It gets easier every semester. I’m in my third semester of my MA and I can’t believe how much better I write now vs my first semester of graduate school. You have to find the groove of the program, get to know the other students and professors. My university has a writing lab with graduate students and professors in the English MA are available to all students and faculty for any writing help. I and some of the graduate students from the English MA go every so often to get helpful feedback on our writing. Your university probably has something like this you can use. "
5622,Questions you wish you had asked before you started in a lab,"I  asked students how hands-on/hands-off my PI was and how he handled things going wrong (I've experienced PIs flying off the handle when something happens that they don't like which no one was prepared for and it's not fun). In retrospect, I also should have asked the PI some of the things others mentioned (expectations with regard to authorship sharing, collaborative projects, how many chapters and publications expected, to what degree I should be prepared to seek independent funding).

I frame everything as ""I"" found this good, ""I"" don't understand this, or ""I"" think it makes more sense if this goes here. Unless I can point to sources showing they have made clear factual errors or show clear grammatical mistakes, I don't explicitly say anything is ""wrong"", just did you look at this source because you haven't mentioned it and it seems to go against what you are saying? And are you going through a whole thesis line-by-line? My own advisors don't have time for that. I was told line-by-line was for the very last draft and not before, and I agree. And always say what the strengths of the work are. "

5628,What's arts and humanities grad school (preferably MA) in the US really like?,"For my program (museum studies) it depends for each class. Typically my profs each have a big project we work on all semester while working on small steps or building blocks as one my profs call them throughout the semester. These are typically something like having an outline, a couple sections, or a rough draft, so that they can ensure we’re not completely off base. It also just helps us get feedback on our ideas and ensures we aren’t doing the entire project at the last minute. Some profs count these building blocks as a part of our grade and others don’t. I don’t have any tests, and I don’t think other classes in my program do either. "

This is ridiculous. Do you know how many students in this class are probably friends that put each others names to get points? Going from an A, not to an A-, but to a B+ IS a huge grade jump for a system that rewards friends for putting each others names. As a current instructor I think this is entirely unfair and would NEVER do this. Students very rarely are able to accurately assess contributions to learning or engagement, and most of the time, esp. for online classes, THEY DON'T CARE. It is far more likely they are putting friends names or random names than carefully considering who has been effectively participating (especially when many of them themselves probably haven't been). For this to affect OPs tuition assistance is horrible. I honestly cannot fathom how people are defending this. "

5640,(need advice) Supervisor moves out to another school,"This happened to me. Your advisor should be able to get you accepted into the program outside of the standard admission time period/channels. I myself ended up in a situation where I am a visiting student at the new school while finishing my degree at the first institution. To be honest, The entire process has been pretty awful for everyone in my group.  For that period where you would be transitioning from school a to school b, I would expect very little support from school b if you aren’t a student there. If your advisor isn’t gonna go to bat for you to try to make the process as easy as possible, it might not be worth it. "

I think having a master's will never really hurt you. If you get to a point where you're applying and you think you're overqualified, you don't have to include it.

I do not want to go on to do doctoral studies. If I did, I should have done that after completing program 1.  Most importantly I want to put my education to use, not acquire more knowledge just for the sake of it.

Do you have a design portfolio? It's expected for undergrad professional programs. It'll be expected for you. Are you willing to spend nights and weekends in the studio, or do you want to relive undergrad?

I was in plant science specializing in crop biotech, but I just can't muster up the effort to care about that anymore.

In 25 years of time, the entirety of the US university system has produced two results in plant biotech.  That's it, two results in a quarter century, and one won't even be on the market for a few years.  I tried to work with so many people to do something about that, I could have done more, but there was a grand total of zero interested in doing their damned job.  They're either incompetent, or paid off corporate shills, and po-tay-to po-tah-to at this point.  And God forbid you talk about anything that isn't a corn/soy monoculture.  Eventually, I dropped out of my PhD program because, first off, that particular place was a mess (they sent me to a ill equipped research station in the middle of nowhere that never should've been built, which was a little detail they neglected to mention when I accepted), and second, the whole field is a disaster.

Science is about making the world a better place for humanity, and in case you haven't noticed there's an impending climate crisis that's going to demand an increased focus on sustainability, but all they're interested in is sitting on their hands and taking about how much they love their corporate handlers.  What a waste of two degrees and too many years, I should have gone into medical biotech from the start, at least that has a future.  No wonder there's an anti-GMO movement, they might be science denialists but they're fully justified in their suspicions, and I am very close to going to Twitter and letting them know exactly how I feel, and since those quacks are always looking for vindication from people with degrees that would be very bridge burn-y but it isn't like I have anything else going for me.

I hope Trump cuts all their funding to zero, since they're not doing anything with it anyway.  At least there's still DIY biotech, since apparently I'm the only one out there who gives a shit. "

It seems like the end result tends to be much more important than the path (i.e. the results, not the methods matter) and project time frames are pretty short. My team also has a lot of check-ins and they're a lot more accessible than faculty can be if something goes wrong.

- lectured a class or two to cover for the professor (Out of town for a conference)
- No training was offered, learn on the fly

5686,longterm relationships within and after grad schools,"Two processes I would say trump creative problem-solving are learning to love actively and perseverance.

Learning to love actively keeps both people in a relationship able to constantly support one another, which improves quality of life both for each individual as well as the couple as a whole. Active love could be creative but is often made up of mundane things that matter little to oneself but a lot to one's partner.

Perseverance despite difficulty allows the relationship to be longterm. Without it, there is no hope of a future. And, the longer it is practiced, the more equinamity and perspective a person develops because they begin to see the large bumps in the metaphorical road as small bumps over a long course. The more difficulties a couple passes through together, the more confident they become that they will be able to surmount other challenges in the future.

Creative problem-solving is useful but I don't see it as the most important quality to come out of a relationship. Rather I would say it is more a sense of agape, of old, familiar, altruistic, and well-humored love. "

5689,Seeking: Job Advice while Applying for Grad School,If you’re in a PhD that is your job. You should be paid as a teaching assistant or research assistance (or through fellowship). Sometimes people take side jobs like bartending or summer internships to make some extra money. Sometimes people will finish off their thesis part time while working full elsewhere. I’m sure depending on the program a part time PhD is possible but it would take a very long time considering a typical full time PhD in the US is 5 years. 
5690,Switching specialities/disciplines for a Postdoc?,"Definitely possible and often recommended to make some sort of a change. It's in your best interest to pick up something new from your postdoc. That may mean going to a place where you can pick up a new technical skill, or perhaps use your current skills to explore a new topic, or some combination of both. I fell into the latter situation, and it was a wonderful experience. "

5694,What are my options when I graduate?,"I'm a recently graduate EE PhD with focus in neural engineering and now have a TT faculty position. Do **not** go into BME unless you want to become a medical device salesman. Find an EE lab with an emphasis on applications rather than theory. Try and get into a top 10 school. Stanford, Berkeley, Michigan, Penn all have outstanding relevant programs. If you're not that competitive, aim for a school that's made a mark on the field. University of Utah, for example, developed the Utah Electrode Array, the only penetrating microelectrode array approved for human clinical trials, is the origin of the original neural amplifier, and is home to 2  prominent neural companies (Blackrock and Ripple). UT Dallas is also in a good situation for a lower ranked University with Abbott neuromodulation being local.

If you get the above, your dreams of academia are possible. The competition for TT faculty is lower for EE than probably any other field. This is because EE PhDs make so much money in industry, why would you accept *half* as much to teach? It's insane (I am TT EE faculty, btw). In fact, many EE faculty don't even do postdocs, which are required for virtually every other academic field.

The next step is to tailor your PhD to the job you want. Teaching oriented colleges want to see industry experience, so get internships in the summer. They also require that you have teaching experience and would prefer if you had experience training undergrads in research and projects, so try and become a senior project advisor during your PhD or mentor undergrads in your research lab. See if your institution has any ""teaching higher Ed"" courses or similar. Mine had an emphasis for phds seeking TT jobs.

Make sure you talk to faculty at other institutions. Connections will be king. I applied to over 20 positions, got interviews from all 3 where I or my advisor new someone, and only 2 of 20 where I didn't. Applying to faculty positions is hard. It took me more than 8 hours per application. Wasting time on applying to places you don't know people, and thus have a low chance, is painful (but necessary). 

If  you don't land an academic job, there are government jobs. Federal jobs are incredibly annoying to apply to, but there are some really cool positions. It is best if you can find a mentor to help you figure out how to apply to the fed jobs, because they are weirdly particular. 

There are also the national labs. National labs fall somewhere between industry and academia. Berkeley national lab is particularly interesting and it specifically has no classified research and had a neuroscience division. Engineers there will usually work as solution innovators for various other departments. I spent 2 years at one and worked with neuroscientists, physicists, biochemists, and others. "

5697,"Career existential crisis thread: Any STEM PhD students completely uninterested in doing a postdoc? What are your career goals? How are you setting/have you set yourself up for success? Those who have started your careers, what did you do during grad school that helped?",">I honestly want to be a full-time faculty member at a community college or smaller school and teach a few courses every quarter/semester. That sounds incredible to me and like a dream come true!

...Am I missing something?  Why not just go to a teaching college?  As an example, [Rollins College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollins_College) in my area generally has professors teach 3-4 classes/semester, publish 1 paper/year (summer), and advise.

Lots of people with PhDs do this - it is, like, 100% of the Rollins' staff.  You need to look up the differences between private/public universities and the difference between research/teaching colleges.  Teaching college professors do not typically do research postdocs for obvious reasons. "
5698,How do I report the duration of my research assistant job on my resume? (weird situation),Payment and funding source don’t matter. List it as the duration of the work. 
5699,Does a Postdoc have to be in the same field as your PhD?,would imagine it would depend on the people looking for the postdoc. in theory I wouldn't have an issue with hiring an English PhD grad for a history postdoc but you'd need to be able to show why i should hire you over the person with more relevant experience and expertise 
5700,Almost done with grad school with no immediate future plans.,"I’d say keep applying to places since they often keep information on file. 

Also up your LinkedIn game. Join professional groups, post and introduce yourself. Upload information on your projects, really hype yourself up and put some effort into networking. I HATE networking particularly in person but I can’t deny the value in it. "
5701,When does it make sense to start over post-PhD?,Seriously a) 6 job applications is nothing you should be doing like 30 a week b) a postdoc may or may not help you if you want an industrial job because only about half of employers count that experience and many don't care about the number of papers you have. Look I know looking for a job is soul crushing and getting rejected from a position you know you are qualified for and you are very interested in sucks but 100% this is a numbers game when it comes to applications. I will also say as far as a postdoc is concerned if you have a chance to do one to learn some new you could argue it was worth it but if you are looking to just publish more it is a gamble. The thing is you could be the Stephen Hawking of your field and if you get assigned a shit project publish literally nothing in which case you probably were better off not doing it.

5703,What Experience Would Have Helped in Grad School?,"Don't get sidetracked by helping other people.

Your priority is YOURSELF. Don't waste time on other people if it is thankless unless it will net you well needed brownie points or, better yet, a publication (2nd author or better). "
5704,If you don't want to be like your advisor should you continue working for them?,"I think that all depends, people are very multifaceted. In terms of mentoring, I don't think I want to be like my advisor because he's much more hands off with all of his students. I don't think it suits MOST people, so I would do that differently.  However I work really well with that style of mentoring, and really like the work we do. "

That said, if academia is the career you want to pursue, I don't see why it wouldn't be a bad idea to go directly into a program after finishing your M.S. (if you aren't feeling burnt out that is- please, please be honest with yourself and take care of your mental health). I guess it really depends on the field. "

5711,Advice during time of cancellations?,"I don't have any advice, I just wanted to say I'm very much in the same boat, except honestly worse off because I don't have close to the wealth of experience you do. I didn't even get accepted to REUs, but just not even having the option to do volunteer research at my lab at my home school over the summer, or potentially not being able to not do a senior thesis, really screws me out of any shot at grad school. It's not like we're CS majors who can just work remotely or work on independent projects to brush up their skills - we really have NOTHING to do this summer (unless you're computational but that is NOT for me, haha).

Still, everything aside, given what you've described, I think you are in a better position than you fear. I'm not trying to say your feelings aren't valid, because they totally are - I feel the same way. But it's clear you're passionate and already have a lot of relevant experience, which will never hurt you no matter what. "

5715,Is the dissertation process outdated?,"Yes.

I think it’s open to members and non-members but I’ve been told by other grad students you have a membership with them. I could be wrong though and you do need a membership to apply to those grants.

5721,I’ve got like a week tops to grade a homework assignment for ~100 students that’s already really past due and the rubric is shoddy. How do I power through this?,"I have been in this position (sigh, lab reports). Based on you mentioning a rubric, I assume this is a written assignment and not, like, a problem set? What I did is, turn the rubric into a spreadsheet that did all the thinking for me. Like, have each column be a part of the assignment's requirements, and have it autocalculate the grade. I know you said the rubric is shoddy, but if you are the only one grading these assignments that gives you a bit of freedom to set this up however makes sense to you.

Then when I did the actual grading, I barely had to think about it at all. Just enter into the spreadsheet as I read each report, ""they got this, they missed this, they did this"". Each lab report got exactly one read-through, and it was pretty fast. I think I sat down in a cafe and just slammed through as many as I could in some time limit. "

I am in an interdisciplinary humanities field and have been catering my research and CV to be appealing for public scholarship/museum work alongside academia. You should look into the types of funding opportunities that are available outside of teaching in your department. I has a research assistant position where I was the assistant editor of a public scholarship blog. I also applied for an RA position specifically for doing research about applying academic training to non academic jobs! (so even if I don't get it, *someone* will be doing this research spring semester with plum funding). Other people in my department have gotten fellowships at our on-campus special collections library. External fellowships are another option—for my area that tends to mean fellowships at museums like the Smithsonian or Getty. For you it might mean a fellowship offered through the US government.

People from my department have gone on to work at museums, tech, music archives, national parks service, consulting...there are options. "

5728,Speaking a second language other than English during meetings?,"I am from a country where English isn't an official language (but sufficient knowledge of English is quite widespread) - and I am doing my PhD abroad, so all the terminology I learned in my PhD is in English. When I visited my native country and talked with my colleagues there, if everyone present could speak our native language, of course we spoke our native language. When I didn't know some term in it, I just said it in English, and usually someone told me the translation. If I wasn't sure what someone is talking about, I'd ask. Altogether it happened only a few times, not enough to notably slow down communication, my colleagues seemed used to it (many people they know do their PhDs abroad, and most visit more often than I), and I don't think it was a problem. And of course it's useful for me to this way learn the current terminology in my native language.

Of course, if you aren't actually fluent in that language and have difficulties following to the extent that having the conversation in English would be more efficient than such occasional explanations, and you understanding and/or contributing to the meeting is important, you should ask for the meeting to be held in English. "
5729,On a scale from Leslie Knope to Jean Ralphio...,"I appreciate the humor in your OP and I like that people are encouraging you. Let me give you another opinion though from a Bourdieusian cultural sociologist: 

Nothing says ""I don't belong"" or ""I'm really educated!"" like preemptively proving that you belong or are highly educated. 

In other words, whether you should do this or not really depends on your field (in both senses) but the higher status the field you are in, the less you want to hang up your diploma. Briefly, putting up your diploma shows that you think of the diploma as a significant accomplishment. But for an ACTUALLY high status person (not just a nouveau riche, or equivalent) getting such a credential is no big deal at all. 

So, by hanging up your diploma, you are basically sabotaging your own symbolic capital - the capital/advantages that come along with 'looking the part' and acting as if succeeding in a given field was perfectly natural and unconsciously achieved. Hanging it up might impress people - but it will only likely impress people with LESS cultural and symbolic capital than you (and therefore the people who can benefit you the least) because everyone with more capital than you will likely have the same or better credential anyway. 

Your diploma does not distinguish you from people with more educational/cultural capital than you. Rather, it distinguishes you from people with less. However, the important point here is the GROUP THAT YOU ARE PUTTING YOURSELF IN. 

(All of this is not completely unrelated to why people like Steve Jobs wore jeans and T shirt to investors meetings where gazillions would be discussed etc... 'all in a day's work for someone as comfortable with this status/world as I am.' It's the overdressed people who out themselves as uncomfortable, like they don't REALLY belong there.)

Of course, I am not saying all of this is NECESSARILY true (as different fields have different logics). But this is one answer that I didn't see in the comments and wanted to share - after all, you have an advanced degree now! 

In summary: I'd look to see what your role models and mentors do and follow them. "
5730,"Landed a prestigious award out of the blue, no idea what to do.",Pitiful brag thread. 
5731,Should I tell my PI my future career plan in Industry?,"As far as I noticed in most of the world most formulation development jobs don't necessarily require a PhD, so that's a bit risky that the PI may question your commitment to finishing your PhD, especially if your PhD isn't giving you relevant skills. If you can address such concerns, then yes, you should be honest with your PI whenever the discussion gets related to your career development / post-PhD future. Most reasonable PIs are actually relieved when they don't have to worry about how to train and place their students for academic career, as long as the students' alternative career plans are sensible and non-embarrassing (e.g., planning to be a janitor, a meth cook or a scammer wouldn't be well-received, but a relevant research/development industry career would, even if the PI may not be able to help much unless they just happen to have contacts in it). "
5732,Joining committees: is it worth it?,"Pros: Being on a university wide committee would be a good addition to the CV. Small teaching institutions tend to heavily rely on service.  So they will see that as a plus. You might get a nice reference letter out of it if you are able to build a relationship with someone there. 

Con: At the end of the day being on a committee does not mean the application will be read differently. Those institutions that rely on service work will stick you with that service work anyway. It will mostly be empty time because committees really work in practice at the board level. The rest is just there. You will also learn to see the stupid bureaucracy of academia first-hand and how meetings are just to do nothing. "
5733,Dealing with conflict,"This person is a volunteer (i.e. not being paid)? Does she have previous experience in any lab? If she is like most students in biology, she's never held any type of employment. Some people don't know the importance of the paperwork before starting work. If she didn't complete it, this would have been a good chance for you to gently remind her when it's due and *reiterate the importance of the training*. Sit with her and figure out an explicit due date. Don't put the onus on an inexperienced student to figure this out. 

Maybe you were being undermined, I don't know. If she's never had experience in this setting, you've now shown her that any mistakes she makes will get her reprimanded. Approach this as if she doesn't know the 'ins and outs' of lab work. You were in her shoes once, how would you like your me your to have addressed this with you? "

You need 2 out of the 3 to succeed:

1. Love your research
2. Like your advisor
3. Like your colleagues

It seems like right now you only have one. The reason why everyone is telling you to speak to the lab mates is because it gives you insight into the lab itself ( how the PI operates).as well as the people you spend time with day to day. Your colleagues are going to be people you spend more time with over the next several years than even your family.

Letters of motivation are typically asked so you can show why you are motivated for a specific position and what you can bring to the university. It gives a chance to have a look at you as a person, separate from your CV.

5781,Asking too many questions already?,"No, keep asking unless he says you're asking too much. Be more explicit and specific in what you want from him. You cant read 'tone' in an email.

5782,"Halfway point in Master's, do I quit or tough it out? Will it be worth it?","Something to consider is whether this counts as a graduate certificate. In Australia half a Masters is usually a graduate certificate or graduate diploma which shows post graduate study. 

It also means you can come back later and work towards a Masters without feeling like you’ve wasted the last few years. "
5783,Transitioning from Academic Science (biostatistics) to Software Engineering?,
5784,Does having a degree from a respected school matter for academic jobs?,"Take my perspective with a grain of salt.  I worked my ass off to get into Carnegie Mellon University.  I came in with a chemical engineering degree from the University of Tennessee.  I loved my undergraduate professors and my classes.  7 years at Carnegie Mellon later, I am burned out, have crippling anxiety, hate myself, have no idea what I'm doing, and I don't feel like I've learned much.  My professors were all very lazy and checked out in class.  Most just recited some lecture slides riddled with errors and made us grade our own homework.  I learned so little I failed my PhD qualifying exam and had to retake it after studying with a mentor for a year to learn all the stuff I was supposed to learn in my coursework.  I had an advisor who could care less about me and never checked in on me until he fired me.  The point I'm making is that it is better to love what you are doing than to have a splashy prestigious school. "

5788,Tips for teaching my first class?,"With such a small group, set norms for class participation from the beginning. Will your lectures be more discussion-based, didactic, experiential, or a mix? Will students be expected to raise their hands or just jump in. Do you want students to interact with each other or just respond to you? Will you call upon students at random or only those who raise their hands?

One strategy I used as a TA was “wait a minute” questions. These would be open questions throughout the lecture that students would have one uninterrupted minute to think about a response to. Even if they had difficulty thinking of anything, we could process that struggle as a group. 

As an instructor with only 8 students, make sure you know each of their names and use them regularly. Make it a habit to integrate what they share in class into your teachings (e.g., “does this remind anyone else of Twyla’s example from last week?”). Check in with students throughout the course about, asking them what they appreciate and what maybe isn’t resonating with them. Listen to what they say without being defensive and be gracious for their feedback. Students can be amazingly forgiving and supportive of instructors who they perceive actually cares about them. 

Good luck!!! "

5792,What is the job market like for someone with a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate degree and an MS in Material Science.,"Many jobs in electrical or mechanical engineering are directly, if not mostly, related to materials. On the mechanical side, you can do all sorts of cool work related to 3D printing, biomedical devices, nuclear reactors, and thermal fluids. On the electronics side, we need packaging engineers galore (especially for emerging fields like bioelectronics or photonics). If you find yourself passionate about quantum and want to venture into the semiconductor field, many foundries (computer chip manufacturers) would love your expertise as modern processes actually use strain engineering to modify the band structure of semiconductors. In short - that combination is actually super employable and can get you work in a variety of interesting fields! "

5798,How do I politely say I want to wait to hear other offers?,"This is  pretty normal, they're going to assume you have other offers and are looking for the best fit so usually people are going to be understanding if you're just upfront about it.  "
5799,"Those of you who either chose to leave or were kicked out of grad school - what do you ""do"" now?","Do you have any other sorts of passions that interest you? I'm in the process of leaving at the end of this semester. I may be in a slightly different situation. Research is just not for me - I just hate it, I don't have the passion and find it more annoying and stressful and don't really get excited or care really about getting good results. I came into the program not planning to pursue research, was thinking regulation, policy, teaching high school or something like community college with no research. And it makes me so miserable it seems insane to stay when the only real reasons I have are to not disappoint my advisor and to not feel bad about quitting. I've also been in the navy so have experience with a high stress long hour job and did fine there, which has immensely helped me realize it's this specific work that is not right for me.

I also switched majors from envi sci to cell bio in undergrad, so am planning to return to envi sci for a more applied job. My biggest regret is that I was in a 5 year undergrad+masters envi sci program and will now at some point need to start over and spend 2 years getting that masters degree, but try to be positive about things. The more important thing for me is that I know myself and I would have constantly been questioning whether I should have done a biomed PhD if I didn't try this. I've also learned and am sure you have whether you realize it or not a ton about juggling tons of tasks, prioritizing, time management, preparing presentations for a specific audience, etc. 

Good luck with everything and I hope it works out! If you do end up leaving for whatever reason remember this- you can dwell in negatives and view yourself as a failure that wasn't good enough. But really research PhDs aren't like undergrad, they are super fucking hard especially at higher level programs and it just means that very specific path, or maybe even just the program you're in now, is not a good fit for you. "
5800,"While Studying for your grad degree, what type of job did you hold down and what was your living situation like?","I still live at home and live in NYC as well. When I started grad school January ‘18, I was working part-time as an admin assistant at a medical school and also did an unpaid internship in the summer and a paid internship in the fall. 

I was let go from my admin job this past January but started a new paid internship in Feb and another in March.  "
5801,Master's in Curriculum & Instruction to teach College-level English?,"I'd also question some of your motives/process here. Why would you want to blaze through a program where you would get no teaching or research experience? That program will not prepare you to teach college-level English. If you are interested in teaching English, find a good MA program that will offer you a funding package. If you are funded, you will probably start in a writing center and then move to a TA position.  "
5802,"I will soon be the last remaining ""senior"" lab member, being pressured to stay after graduation as a post-doc. What would you do in my situation? Help!","Is it possible to stay there as a staff instead of a post-doc? Or can you secure a staff position after a term of post-doc? If neither, I don’t see a reason why you should stay since you said you prefer an industry job in the first place. 
However when it comes to the end all that matters is whether you love what you do. So why not simply follow your heart? Try to imagine what suggestions you will give to yourself as a person 20 years from now. This helped me several times when it came to tough decisions. Hope it helps you too. Good luck buddy "

5807,Working and going to school,"I work full time, 4 days a week, 10 hour days, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. I’m part time in school, doing 2 classes a semester (with full time being 3). Luckily, my job is very laid back and has a good amount of downtime so I can read while at work. During my three days off, Tuesday’s I spend at school preparing for the class I have that night. Wednesday’s are my “off days” I give to myself. I might do some reading in the morning, but I really use it to run errands, and I might I allow myself a few hours to play video games with my friends. Thursday’s is another class days, so that’s also spend reading and in class. I’m almost constantly busy, which is exhausting and I really don’t have the ability to fit in any last minute plans, but it’s working for now I guess. I’m hoping I can land a graduate student job and quit my full time job so I can go full time in school and really just give my all to that, but it’s not looking like that’s going to happen at this point, so I’ll keep this little system I have in place.

5808,MBA vs. MHA: Not sure what to do.,"Some schools offer dual MBA-MHA degrees, like GSU. Even if they don't advertise it, it's something you can ask about "
5809,I’m carrying a 4ft tube with my poster on a plane tomorrow to go to conference. It is my first time so is there anything should be aware of?,"It depends on the airline, and the class you're traveling in, and how full the flight is, and on the gate staff, and on the cabin crew.

At various times I've put a tube in the overhead bin, let a flight attendant tuck it in a handy nook behind a row of seats, and checked the tube (I own a heavier-duty plastic poster tube I picked up from an art supply store) so I didn't have to deal with it.

I could also see you being asked to gate-check the tube if it's a crowded flight. If you're flying one of the low-cost carriers, they might also look for a way to ding you for some kind of extra-bag charge.

In all cases, make sure you've got your name and contact info on the outside of the tube, just in case you get separated. (Have a digital copy of your poster with you, too--in the worst-worst-case scenario, you might be able to get the poster reprinted at a local print show.) 

One time I paid a bit of a premium for printing on fabric so I could fold the poster and put it in my laptop bag.

The last time I went to a conference, I went business class by train (the boss signed off on it because it was cheaper than flying economy class).  Lounges at both ends, complimentary food and drinks on board, lots of legroom, and no worries about luggage or poster storage space.  And the train station was across the street from the conference hotel, which was handy after all the free booze. "

5812,"My advisor owes me past-due teaching and research salary, refuses to pay, university is ignoring me",What about getting in contact with the school president or something? Or the head of your department? Why not contact every professor in your department and explain what's going on and see what they recommend.  
5813,Adventures in Exam Invigilation,You are making me so happy that the worst thing a student did during exam today was draw me a dinosaur on the exam. 
5814,How should you dress in graduate school?,What type of question is this 
5815,I am a Multimedia Designer - What Master's Degree Should I Get?,"i did media studies as an undergrad, and it's really all about lacanian psychology and communication theory. super interesting stuff but not exactly relevant to modern media production. what skills are you looking to \~master\~? if it's solely about design or production, i'd err towards the first 2 options. the second two are more theory-based, though communications relate more so to business/marketing skills "
5816,"Are any of you familiar with this blog, ""100 Reasons NOT to Go to Graduate School?""","Yeah. The reasons are...less than compelling. 
A few favorites:

#6: Intellectual expectations are falling. 
#9: It is very, very hard. 

Wait, what? These are contradictory. And also...yeah, it's supposed to be hard!

#10: It takes a long time to finish. 

Sure...most things worth pursuing take lots of time. It takes a lot of time to build a career as a programmer. It takes a long time to learn how to be a good farmer. It takes time to build a business. It sure as hell takes a long time to get a doctorate, because it's something worth doing!
 "
5817,Grad School pathway decision?,"Start your chemistry industry job and get that experience and money. While you're there, you can build a good relationship with your boss and other qualified people who can write you decent rec letters. I just got into a PhD program with all of my rec letters from people that I worked with after completing undergrad. "
5818,"What is your routine like? I’m interested in how you’re days/weeks go, whether you schedule things out or go with the flow.","I make a pretty detailed schedule for myself for what I want to accomplish each day but don’t schedule the hours the things will be done in. At the start of the week, I’ll figure out what the biggest task for each day will be and try to coordinate that around any meetings or classes I have (i.e. Monday will be experiment A, Tuesday will be literature review, Wednesday will be animal colony management, etc.). I’m generally less effective on Mondays and Fridays so I try to leave those days for easier, less brain-intensive stuff. Every morning I sit down and make a list of every single task I need/want to get done that day (I am super scatterbrained and will forget to do stuff if I don’t do this), and anything that doesn’t get finished that day gets kicked to the next day’s to do list. 

My boss doesn’t care when I come into lab as long as I’m getting stuff done, but I prefer to get in by 9. I really prefer to finish all my work (including studying) before I go home if possible because I’m much less efficient there, so I’ll stay however long I need to which varies by day based on my workload, so yesterday I worked 11 AM-7 PM, today I worked 7AM-5PM, tomorrow I’ll probably work 10 AM-3 PM, etc. I try very hard not to go into lab on weekends, because I’ve worked research jobs before where the boss expected me to be there every damn day, including the weekends, and it burned me out so badly that I was overall less effective and efficient at getting stuff done, even during the regular work week. Obviously I’ll do stuff at home when I need to (for example, I’m preparing for quals right now so I’ve been doing a few hours of studying once I get home most nights too), but I prefer to be done and be able to relax and have dinner, watch tv, or work on one of my hobbies when I get home. 

I schedule reading/studying/project work in a planner every week, similar to how I plan my week in lab. Life responsibility stuff and social stuff also go in this planner (as well as my Google calendar for events/appointments so my phone will remind me, since, as I mentioned above, I’m scatterbrained as fuck). I DEFINITELY suggest scheduling fun/social stuff/breaks or even putting one night a week aside where you don’t do any work or school stuff. Work/life balance is super important to maintaining your sanity and it’s basically the guiding principle around how I do everything.  "
5819,Job interview questions (non-faculty positions) that I could/should have answered better,"So these are all ""behavioral interview questions"" that are designed to be answered with the ""STAR"" method- Situation Task Action Result.

I routinely comment on these types of threads because I found these questions most infuriating/difficult to answer during my interview process until a friend gave me a great tip. Have 3 stories prepared for an interview where you wind up the rockstar: you advocated for a changed procedure in your lab, you won a poster contest at a conference, you helped a student pass their course in your lecture, etc. 

Within each of those stories, you should have an answer to just about any behavioral interview question that could arise. Before this set up, I found the lack of constraint on those types of questions to be difficult because my mind goes to the pretty extreme answers that interviews typically don't want to hear about. But having prepared stories to draw from really helped me shape my answers in the way that interviewers expected to hear (even if I think this is a crap system for asking candidates questions).  "
5820,Anxiety surrounding relationship with my advisor,"Being accepted to a conference is a good thing for both of you, no reason to be anxious. I'd make an effort to meet at least once a week to touch base with your projects and goals.  "
5821,How can I help a labmate give better presentations?,"- Giving *unsolicited* advice to a *peer* can be risky --- you may inadvertently offend them.

- Realize that there are different ways to give a good presentation, and what works for some people may not work for others. You should be prepared to justify your advice.

- Even if you've been asked to give feedback, there's an art to doing this well. I like to focus on my experience as an audience member rather than the speaker's presentation skills (no ad hominem attacks). An example: ""I found it difficult to follow the reasoning on slide X; it would be great if you could explain concept Y"" vs. ""You were confusing on slide X; you should have explained Y"". If you need to point out something potentially embarrassing/damaging, do it tactfully (perhaps in private).

- If you are both practicing for a joint presentation, you could suggest taking turns to present and give each other feedback. Also, give praise when appropriate; don't just focus on the things that need improvement.

> Sometimes we are asked to give joint presentations to the same audience, or ""split time"" on a single talk. I have started to decline this requests, as I don't like trying to merge my talk with his. This hurts me, as I truly love talking about my science. (I kinda feel bad about this.)

Why do you not like merging your talk with his? "
5822,Can a hiring manager or recuriter contact your adviser about how bad you interviewed?,Argh *recruiter  
5823,Need advice (concerning lab responsibility),"In my experience put down what you are comfortable with in regards to whether you are or are not available at that time.  Leave it at that.  

People will be able to draw conclusions on their own. "
5824,Asking Professors for Multiple Academic References,"A letter of reference doesn’t have to know you personally, they just need to be a testament of your professional life and work ethic.

If you’re in grad school, your courses should be relatively small and your professors will have seen you complete projects at a very advanced level. The professors you mentioned would be fine writing a letter.

If it helps, the best way to approach a letter writer is to explain what it is you want and why you believe you should be the one to have it. This will give your letter writers something to go off of.

Here’s an example 

“Hello, I’m XXX. I am really enjoying your course this semester and have found it interesting, challenging, and fun. The course has helped me grow as a [insert field here] scholar. In order to expand my horizons even more so, I am applying to [insert fellowship, internship, etc.] This opportunity is for students who blah blah blah. I am applying because I want to do/be/create XYZ. As someone who has seen me work in this area of study and are capable of giving an honest testimony of my professional work ethic, I would be really honored if you could write a letter of recommendation? Could you write this letter on my behalf? .....

Just let your professor know what it is you want, why you should get it and let them fill in the blanks! "
5825,Getting a second Master's degree?,"Meh, you do you. "
5826,Can I add students on Facebook after the semester is over?,"It's fine. Kinda weird, but not unheard of, but whatever. It used to be normal for grad student to marry their advisor so.... "
5827,"Got into grad school, trying to get a new job. Best course of action?",
5828,opinion on Fellowship programs after graduating with a Masters?,"Pros: get good work or research experience
Cons: not a permanent job "
5829,What is the purpose of post-doctoral work and is it necessary for every PhD?,"Postdocs do have the Dr. title, not sure why you think otherwise. If you are not planning to go into academia I see little reason to pursue post-doctoral work unless it is to learn a skill that makes you more marketable for the job market (a skill rather than the qualification of being a post-doc) "
5830,How do you make connections in grad school?,"I think it depends on how “involved” you want to be. It’s totally a personal choice.

I think TAing definitely helps build your network. And for me personally, it is extremely satisfying to explain things and help out. "
5831,Can doing a postdoc hurt my chances of getting a job in industry?,"Most of the positions for a scientist in industry (at least in my field) require postdoctoral experience nowadays, so have a look at available positions and what they want. If you find a good job that doesn’t require postdoctoral experience, you’d just save time by going straight for the job. "
5832,"If you received an MA in Communications, how has it helped your career?",
5833,A blog I wrote about SOPs that might help those who are just starting off as grad students in life science,
5834,First professional conference in grad school - tips to ease nerves?,"As a freshman undergrad, the only thing I can say is that you're there for a reason and they were in your position before. You got this. "
5835,"Stuck in grad school for another month, how to approach job search?","Why is it so important that you lock down a job now? I’m assuming your school still has a few months left in the semester and it sounds like your preoccupation with your job search is getting in the way of your thesis. 

You’re likely never again going to get such self-focused studio time, where it’s all about you and what you want to make and actively working to make your work better. Embrace that. It’s a huge privilege. Once you’re out in the real world, the work will almost never be about you again. You’ll have to answer to others and change it to suit their non-design-educated tastes. So save that stuff for after school or at least for after your thesis. Especially if you’ve got rent covered until September. You have more time than you think.  "
5836,should I do a masters right after graduation or work for a couple of years first?,"My advice is: get some work experience before you start grad school. Even just some internships would suffice, so you can get a better idea of what are your specific interests. I went on to do a MSc right after my bachelor, and I wouldn't say I regret it, but it wasn't the wisest choice of mine: I went for a comparative politics master at the London School of Economics. After graduating, I started interning for the UN, the EU and other organizations, and realized my main area of interest is security, peace and conflict, political instability. If I would have done internships before my MSc, then my choice for grad course would have definitely been international relations or conflict studies, other 2 masters offered by the London School of Economics but different from mine. Some say my choice was great because I graduated with a master at 23 years old and started UN career at the same age, but now you know what? I'm searching for another master, whether in the US or in the UK, to get some international relations/human rights/security studies credentials. 

If you are unsure about what your career will be, or you have a broad interest in a huge topic (that was my case: international relations and politics), do some work to get a more specific choice orientation towards your postgraduate education.  "
5837,Post MA help?,
5838,Listing published conference abstracts on CV/Researchgate?,"Publications should be listed under a separate section. Publications include, but are not limited to, the following:

- journal articles,
- magazine articles,
- conference papers ( e.g., in the proceedings), and
- books or book chapters.

You should use a standard bibliographic style for your field for the listing, and sort them in reverse chronological order (most recent first). If you have a lot of publications, you can also consider grouping them by type (e.g., journals, conferences) or topic.

Presentations on the other hand are typically used for invited talks, e.g., as a keynote speaker, seminar speaker, panelist.


 "
5839,Interview Follow up Advice,"If they didn’t directly offer you a position after the casual meeting, I’d suggest a short thank you, a sentence about how you’d like to join the lab in future, and attaching your CV at the bottom "
5840,Social Best Practices in Grad School,Don't get in the middle of disputes. Being neutral and nice to everyone will seldom work against you.  
5841,salary negotiations at non-academic job interviews,"Hmm, if it's for a state government, they may have set steps/grades/levels that may not be as negotiable as you think based on the amount of experience you have.  With a range that wide, I would do some research on the salary scales or even current employee salaries (this should be public information). Then, I would aim for a salary in line with your experience (the grade) and other salaries you find.  

I wouldn't mention the tuition reimbursement, because as a person no longer in grad school, you have a degree and that degree is worth something.  I would say that my skills, knowledge and abilities are worth X amount (based off the salary research you have done).  I would not base my pay off of my history as a grad student.  Moreover, the agency probably will understand that a grad student wasn't making a ton of money, and they'll start you out at a ""competitive"" grade/step.  Again, it's important to do your research!

5843,"Can you work outside your bachelor's field, then return to the field for grad school?","My friend got his Bachelor's in Business management then got accepted to Med school after only taking the introductory bio classes and a few chem courses. You can absolutely change your path, regardless of doing your grad school, med school, or whatever. And since you plan on returning to the same field anyway it won't be an issue for you at all. Good luck! "
5844,Capstone project vs thesis project,"In my experience, going through the process of developing, conducting, writing, and revising a thesis project is incredibly useful and important if you plan to proceed to the PhD.

There are some people in my cohort who did not write a thesis during their MAs. They made a portfolio or something of work they've done in their courses, or wrote an extra seminar paper. Here are some of the questions, struggles, frustrations, etc. they've shared with me:

-they don't know what the IRB is or what the rules are (whereas I had to figure it out and learn it from my advisors as my thesis was person-based)

-they've never written anything longer than 20 double-spaced pages and they have no idea how to pace themselves or how long it'll take them, or how to write transitions and be consistent across multiple chapters

-they don't quite understand or appreciate the method and methodology sections of papers as much because they've never had to go through the process themselves

-their work mainly revolves around theory and already-published works, which makes it harder for them to publish (at least in our field) 

This probably greatly varies by field, but in mine where we do quite a bit of qualitative research, not writing & researching a thesis puts you at a bit of a disadvantage NOT necessarily for admissions but for your progress in the program. My cohort who had capstone experiences are not as prepared as those of us who wrote 3-5 chapter theses. If you can write a thesis, definitely do it, because it seriously teaches you so much and prepares you for the kind of work you'll be doing in the PhD (the diss, of course, but other more involved studies you may take up along the way).

That's my $0.02, at any rate.  "
5845,Advice for an interview about working with my PI?,"It is totally reasonable to ask for a list of questions in advance for a newspaper interview. Also, remember that since this is for a paper, they will pick the things that sound best. Nervousness doesn't show up in text!

Take a breath, speak honestly, and remember you can always request that they dont use something if you feel weird about it after saying it. Good luck! "
5846,"New PhD graduate, starting over...with unpaid internship?",I wouldn't take an unpaid position period. You can easily get a job as an editor or a proof reader and start off with a decent salary. Take the time to build experience and then work your way into the field you want.

The program I'm in currently isn't technically PFF, but a similar hybrid. I've found the pedagogy seminars/resources mildly useful.

5856,It's super early into my grad school experience and I don't feel well,"I know feedback can suck sometimes. I've forced myself to like it because it is honestly necessary.

Imposter syndrome is real, but remember, they admitted you because you have potential, not because you come perfect. "

5858,Best PhD program for health economics?,"organiker is right... you need to figure this out a little more. But for HE, it depends where you want to work and in what capacity. The USA is very different from the rest of the world, and then Canada and the UK and mainland Europe (and Australasia) are all different, too. Are you interested in consulting or working in pharma or public health or a hospital or a government agency? Why a PhD? A PhD is research training, but if you go into industry you probably won't be doing research. But, on the other hand, there is a soft ceiling for Master's degree holders... many break through, but it's easier with the PhD. Are you interested in real-world evidence (epidemiology) or modelling or something else? Would you want to intern with a pharma company during your PhD or not?

But, what organiker is saying holds true... there's no ""best"" program for anything, really. Getting through a ""best"" program doesn't guarantee a job or your happiness. If you can identify your desires first, you can figure out what are reasonable options and pick from there. "

If you email the people you would like to work with, they can tell you when their school will advertise the next PhD vacancy. "
5861,"Applying for a postdoc, how long should I wait before moving on to the next?","Don't wait at all. Apply simultaneously to as many postdocs as possible, go to interviews and keep applying to other jobs.

5865,PhD in Analytical Chemistry or Biochemistry?,"I am currently working in a Biotechnology company with many interesting ongoing projects that generate revenue for the company. I graduated with my B.S. Chemistry and I will let you know what I have observed in the real world 2018 and later years. This is just my own personal observation and my point of view. If you would like to be employable the best thing to do is probably go get some work experience if you have not done so already BEFORE embarking on your PhD. NO, being a teaching assistant for an undergrad lab does not count, and NO just being a paid Researcher by your PI does not count. I mean go to a non-academic setting (which you have stated you would like) and see what the difference in culture is between doing science just to do science and get research grants & publications vs doing science to gain capital and profits. HUGE DIFFERENCE!!!!!!. NOBODY and I mean NOBODY wants to hire a PhD with no work experience in their field. If you do manage to get a job with your PhD with no work experience in that field you are either: that 0.01&#37; with great networking + LUCKY and hit the jackpot, or you will hate your life and regret ever wasting 5-6,7 years in getting your PhD. Getting a PhD without prior work experience in that field is almost career suicide in most cases, and if you did not graduate from a top 10 school good luck ever trying to land a Tenure Faculty position. I graduated from a mid-tier level school and 8/10 of the Tenure Faculty positions are from top 10 schools(MIT, Berkeley, Nortwestern, etc) for their PhD or Post-Doc.

As far as which PhD program offers better employability.... It really does not matter. It is more of the SKILLS you have gained that matters and what instrumentation + software's are you proficient in as each company is going to differ greatly in what they want. Example, a company isn't going to care if you have your PhD in Analytical or Biochem when all they are looking for is someone who has vast knowledge over Method Development + Validation using Mass Spec and whatever software they run such as Empower or MassLynx. Right now currently we are hiring an Analytical Chemist PhD level, but if someone with only a Bachelors in Chemistry that has 6-8 years of Method Development under their belt, they will be a good candidate. Versus a PhD level Analytical Chemist that doesn't even know how to use the software because they did their Thesis on something completely unrelated to the job they are applying for and have zero experience on it. Situation dictates and each scenario is going to differ greatly. 

Personally, I would go with Bioanalytical Chemistry as it is a both sub-disciplines of Biochemistry + Analytical Chemistry. I am actually going to do my PhD in Bioanalytical Chemistry. Some quick pointers! Get to know as much mass spectroscopy as you can as it is the single most powerful analytical instrument in Chemistry, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology. Learn GCMS if you can but the MOTHER of them all to learn that will increase your employability is LCMS-MS Triple Quadro Polar. The best manufacturers for Mass Spec most used in industry is either Waters Acquity, Agilent, and Shimadzu; so try to get to play on those. Software's to learn are Empower and/or Mass Lynx. If you do not know any of this you will struggle in landing any type of Analytical Chemistry PhD level work whether its in proteomics, drug discovery, etc. As far as pure Biochemistry, the employability is really low and I would not do it. Learn Biochem on the go on your own time and just know that Analytical Chemistry is the most employable. Good luck in your future endeavors.  "
5866,I have a BA in Psych and want to build hotels,"If it helps. I think a Masters in Project Management (or equivalent) is probably useful for you since you want to be the leading role. My own university also has a Master of International Tourism and Hospitality Management which sounds like something you can pursue as a postgrad (so look for something equivalent). 

If you're financially comfortable, you can just drop your job and finish your Masters ASAP and land yourself in a higher leadership position, maybe more paths will present themselves that way. "

5869,Blog?,"I've been mulling starting a blog for years and am close to actually doing so. (I got sidetracked by building a website for it...) So I've put a lot of thought into it and written stuff that I haven't put up yet.

I'm in computer science (robotics, specifically) and there are a million and a half blogs out there. Academic Twitter is also pretty active. My advisor actually has a blog post that went pretty viral within the academic community and is still popular a few years on. She was nervous when it went up, because she was flying in the face of what academia says you're supposed to do in tenure track (she claimed you shouldn't work 24/7), but the response was overwhelming supportive. I know of a number of really good academic CS blogs that have interesting takes on topics. It probably won't help you get tenure, but it's definitely not looked down on.

I plan to start with it mostly being selfishly about me. By that I mean that I want to use it to help me develop my writing style and work through concepts, rather than trying to achieve something specific with it.

One topic/area is documenting things I make, for fun or research, hardware and software. It's good practice to write down how you did something as you're doing it, both for your future self and others who might be trying to achieve the same thing. It's sort of like an informal lab notebook.

Another topic is writing out explanations of things I'm learning. There's the adage saying that you don't understand something unless you can teach it. Writing out a high level explanation for lay people (or at least scientifically inclined lay people) is a great way to prevent myself from getting lost in the weeds. Also good for developing my science communication chops.

Lastly, I want to write more general pieces -- op-ed style or sharing general information like tips on applying for fellowships. I really enjoy outreach and would like to get involved in policy a bit, so this is my space for thinking about connecting to things outside the lab, like ethics, policy, society, etc. "

5879,University still requiring students to come to campus after governor closes ALL educational institutes statewide.,"Unless the businesses across the street close down, there is no reason to close your lab down.

It's not a zombie virus where you barricade yourself in your house. If you can't work remote then you go to work if you don't have symptoms, aren't at risk etc. Skip going to lunch with the guys and wash your hands and wipe down your desk, computer mouse etc. surfaces you touch.

Education is shut down because they put dozens or hundreds of people in a single room to listen to one person talk in front of a powerpoint. You can get better results by moving that shit online and people can type in questions and you even get a free recording and transcription out of it.

If it gets so bad that the businesses shut down, they'll let you know. Not all areas are affected so much that you need to abandon all work and barricade the doors. "

5888,Any other confused NDSEG fellows out there?,"Hi, I'm happy to have found this post. I am also a new NDSEG awardee. There is another person in my research group who will be going into his third year on NDSEG. He has told me a great history of how terribly STI-Tech managed the award with a whole host of problems. It has been a huge headache for him. So the 2019 class can at least look forward to new management of the award because it seems difficult to do much worse of a job than STI-Tech has done the past two years.

My colleague said that STI-Tech typically wouldn't pay fall semester tuition until September, which is much later than the deadline for most schools I know of. STI-Tech was supposed to notify all of the institutions that this would be the case but sometimes they failed to do this. This caused a lot of annoying email exchanges and phone calls for my colleague. Everything worked out in the end, he did not have to pay any fees and his tuition got paid, but it was much more complicated than it needed to be and wasted a good bit of his time.

About three weeks ago I called the STI-Tech office and asked when they would be paying tuition and when I should expect to hear from them regarding how third party billing will be set up. They told me that they were going to send out an email about this by the end of that week... It's been three weeks and they never sent an email about any of that and now they are apparently not in charge of the award anymore. I don't know what to make of this either and I also plan to contact Systems Plus, Inc. sometime this week.

All in all I think everything will work out in the end but I'm sure it will be a pain in the ass for all the students. I think once the transition is completed hopefully things will be better but this first semester might be rough. In the mean time I think all of the NDSEG students that are on here should keep sharing whatever information we have. As far as advice I don't think I can provide any other than just send emails and make calls till they get their shit together. "

Any advisor that holds multiple students 7+ years or gains a reputation for doing so will lose out on the opportunity to recruit the best students.

&#x200B;

In terms of reputation...The number and quality of postdocs is more an indication of reputation than number of grad students. Whether a grad student is successful or not usually depends on a number of factors outside the control of the prof (e.g. how interested the student becomes in research over the course of 5 to 6 years-a lot changes in one's life in this time).  But the top labs are majority postdocs and the postdocs there are already highly accomplished from grad school. "

Would you have a few minutes to discuss it with me in more detail so I could learn more about your work?"" from another professor in a different country.

That said, fuck your school for not valuing the contributions and health of its student body! What they're asking of you isn't demeaning because of its nature, it's demeaning because the administration is saying ""we don't care about you, the work you've been doing or the contract we have with you"".

But I worry about my colleagues, since I moved here from an experimental bio lab which has for the most part, stopped mid stride. It's also making communication with faculty difficult since more negotiating is done face to face (otherwise I'd need to make effort to.. articulate myself in email xD), and classes are a mess because I think most people expected the lockdown to ease by this time.

Trying to stay positive, but I'd like some systemwide assurances in place in these uncertain times. Of course, year extension of faculty tenure advancement, PhD funding would be great. I also hope external funding bodies recognize the difficulties like this and perhaps consider extension to their funding as well.

I transcribe professionally, and have used it for several years with no major complaints. "
5912,Can anybody enlighten me what Reviewer 1 really wants me to do? Lol,"I agree with the other comments here. The reviewer is really just saying that the way your paper is written it sounds as if your findings are completely novel OR that your interpretation of your findings is skewed because you don't seem to realize what the field has already accomplished. This is a comment you WANT since they say several good things about your work before criticizing.  


To handle this, you likely need to add a line in the introduction mentioning what others in the field have already found on this topic (and where the gap of knowledge is), and in your discussion where you compare your findings to other papers. Sometimes you confirm previous work and sometimes you contradict previous work. If you contradict someone else's paper, it is good to discuss why this may be (e.g. we used X instead of Y, changing the context of those findings). Even if your work agrees with previous findings the discussion allows you to highlight what your study adds to the field. "
5913,How much are PIs supposed to help?,"Wish I could tell you what you want to hear but it’s going to depend on the PI. I’m coadvised and both of my PI’s expect you to get up to speed on your own with zero hand holding. 

Regardless of the PI they’re likely not going to invest much in you until you join, and even then, in my experience you’re expected to get more independent as time goes on. "
5914,Advice for learning python for grad school?,"Python is definitely the way to go if your advisor allows it.  It seems to be beating out Matlab for data analysis.

I learn by doing and I recommend conpleting some coding challenges at project Euler to test your ability.  I do this for every new language I have to learn.  I also found [this](https://www.w3resource.com/graphics/matplotlib/) set of matplotlib excersises. "

5917,Probability of getting a week off for vacation during first-year lab rotation?,"One thing I would check is your university's travel requirements and other policies for returning to school in the fall. At my university, because of COVID, if you leave the state you are required to self-quarantine for two weeks once you return. So if you were at my university, your one week vacation would mean three weeks not being on campus. I would expect that many schools have this or a similar policy right now. (I don't work in a lab so can't comment on that part). "
5918,Looking for Remote Research Opportunities. What should I do?,"Try asking professors with similar research interests at your university if they have any research positions open. You can also try reaching out to other schools or places if they accept any interns as well. You just have to ask respectfully and if you seem like a good fit, they’ll reach out to you. "

5921,Where to find old MA/PhD theses (humanities)?,"https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/services/theses/Pages/theses-canada.aspx

This is more Canadian-specific content, but I think it might be helpful. A lot of very very very old theses aren't on here, but some old ones are. I've found many that can be accessed directly on the website in PDF format, but if it's not available, then it usually tells you where there is a physical copy. 
  
There are also newer theses, but I think the newest ones (defended within the last few years) aren't up yet. "
5922,Do people really steal dissertation work for publishing?,"This happened to a colleague of mine, actually.  He put his masters thesis up online through the university library (as is standard) before submitting the related papers.  Then he got an email from some cheeky kid in a far away country who had decided to reformat & restructure his thesis as a paper, and wanted my colleage to be a co-author... "
5923,Research is getting restricted into just simulations with not much mathematical analysis being done.,"To start with, do you understand the mathematics being done in the papers? Not only in terms of things like basic probability, but also in terms of why are the formulas the way they are, why do the authors do this operation instead of that, etc. But I totally get it, I was extremely frustrated with my research (antennas) basically becoming ""throw these numbers into the simulator and pray that it works"" because of a combination of me not understanding the available theory and that a good portion of what I was doing had no available mathematical analysis at all.

5927,Industry collaborations during PhD -- What am getting myself into?,
5928,How do i include the current pandemic into my thesis? and where?,I’d add a discussion in your conclusion noting this as a limitation. I’d recommend taking time to think about how it might have changed your findings and note those possibilities there. 
5929,"Currently under quarantine, and writing seems to be the hardest this time.","If you aren’t ill, you are just socially distancing. Quarantine suggests that you are or have been ill and are legally required to be confined as ordered by a medical officer.

5930,Do you have a good or toxic PhD advisor?,I feel like this needs a “neutral” option. I’d guess a great number don’t stand out as either good or toxic. 
5931,How do you choose the right way to frame the story of your paper?,"Figure out which journal you want to publish in, or which academics you want to model yourself after. Read their work and see how they frame their story. "
5932,"Every time more senior collaborator doesn't like the results, it's my fault",
5933,Can we talk about the need to update NIH trainee funding guidelines,"I think there could be a bigger picture to look at here. \[In my experience,\] Undergrad prepares students for grad school. Grad school prepares students to be independent researchers operating their own research projects in their own labs.

My experience getting a chemistry job after undergrad, everything I needed to be familiar with was covered in job training. Not once did I utilize the skills I developed to get a BS. I fear getting a PhD level job will be similar in that I've trained 5-6 years for a job that's not going to utilize the skills I developed in developing research plans, communicating results, finding funding, etc. 

&#x200B;

A better question might be: why does industry require PhDs when frequently a wholly independent researcher is not the job? "

5941,Has anyone been let go by their professor because of the quarantine?,Not me. First and foremost have you talked to both your graduate program coordinator (the head honcho faculty) and your grad program administrator (the non faculty that makes the program move)? Do this ASAP if not. 
5942,The Good PI,"My PI is awesome. Times are tough these days and remote research has been a struggle for us all. Sometimes I forget how lucky I am to have such a good mentor, so this is as much a reminder to myself as it is an anecdote for everyone else. 

I got interested in his research as an undergrad, as he was one of the only scientists on campus working in a somewhat niche but rapidly expanding field that I wanted to get into. I went to his office hours to introduce myself, and we ended up chatting for a bit about his research. By the end of the semester, we had spoken a few times, and I was pretty sure I wanted to join the lab as an undergrad volunteer. 

I remember asking one of his TAs what he was like to work with, and I’ll never forget the response. The first word the TA used was “humble”. Not smart, not innovative, not funny, but humble. And that stood out to me. The TA, who I had a lot of respect for and who’s class I enjoyed, told me that the PI listened and was receptive to other people’s ideas and suggestions, that he was down to earth, and that he was easy to work with. 

So fast forward, and I’ve been in this lab for about a year now. Sometimes my PI scares me, but I know that behind his intensity, he means well. He is receptive to feedback, and he lets us learn by making our own mistakes. Another grad student once told me that my PI was more likely to watch me struggle for 6 months that to come right out and tell me I was making a mistake. I know that’s not the ideal environment for everyone, but I am thriving under his guidance, and I have so much respect for him as a scientist and as a mentor. 

Tl;dr: my PI is awesome, but sometimes I need to remind myself of that. "
5943,Nothing If Not Humbling," 

>Reviewer 2 is particularly harsh, saying that this manuscript you’ve agonized over is “poorly written.” Unfortunately, they’re not wrong, and it’s two more years before you get a publication. 

 Is it just me, or are all Reviewers #2 unnecessary nitpicky and negative? "
5944,Deciding on a Thesis Topic?,Have you talked to any professors who might serve as your advisor for the thesis? 
5945,"PSA: If you're using ScholarOne, the revision deadline expiration ""due on [date]"" means you have to submit it before that date","Some journals don't give you a deadline for revision, but generally within few weeks to a month. I've used ScholarOne for submissions and this is definitely a journal by journal decision. "
5946,"I can’t be the only one struggling to title my thesis, right??","Hi I've had the same issue as I'm also doing interdisciplinary work! It's a challenge but ultimately you just have to own your decision. Obviously a title is important, but I have also seen some pretty bad titles on published papers so I can't imagine anything you come up with could be THAT bad. "
5947,Anyone still working on campus?,"We have been shut completely down for weeks. Any activity in the building that is 'essential' had to get approved by the department chair, the dean, and the university's VP of research. All PIs were required to submit a detailed plan about who, what, where, and why. We are shut so far down that even faculty need to seek permission from the chair to enter the building for any reason and they must sign in and out. As for our lab, we brought everything to a halt pretty quickly and even euthanized our entire mouse colony. All labs that have animals in the facility were encouraged to euthanize any animals that were not actively being used in an experiment.  

I think how the university has handled this situation is very reflective of how the state as a whole has handled it. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has actually been very on top of everything and quite frankly has probably saved a ton of lives. The university has been really quick to launch policies that follow the guidelines being laid out by the Governor as things have gotten more restrictive over time. I don't often say that I'm glad that I live in Ohio, but man am I glad I live in Ohio. "
5948,Advice for writing a thesis conclusion chapter - humanities,"Dos and don'ts as per my advisor. Do: ""Remind me why do I care. I've just read the whole thesis, I don't remember what you said in the intro"". Don'ts: ""Don't say that more research is necessary. More research is always necessary"" "
5949,Struggling to pick a rotation lab; pls help,"It's totally fine to arrange to meet/call with the professors you're even just vaguely interested and ask to hear about their work that way. A list of 13 may be a bit much for this, but 6-8 would be totally reasonable. Professors expect this to happen -- they've been through the process and know how it works -- and won't be offended if you don't end up working with them in the short- or long-term. 

If you meet with them, make sure to ask what direction they want to move in over the next five-ish years! You and your advisor need to have a strong mentoring relationship independent of the content of the science, but it's also important that you guys have the same vision for the scientific direction of your thesis work. I rotated with one PI who was  trying to wrap up their work in my topic and move on to something else, and was trying to make me move in that direction, too. "
5950,A helpful SciHub browser extension,
5951,What is the difference between Ethnographic and Qualitative research?,"First, you might need to clarify the distinction between methodology and method. A methodology is a given approach to research, specifically its epistemological and ontological commitments to knowledge production. A method is a specific technique used to produce knowledge and it needs to align with the methodology. So, action research is a methodology and participant observation could be a method one uses in such a study. 

Qualitative research is a very broad, and sometimes contested, term that generally refers to any research that produces knowledge in ways that do not rely on numbers (e.g., statistics). Ethnography is largely considered to be one of the first qualitative methodologies, and through it emerged a set methods (e.g., participant observation) that are now used in other qualitative methodologies (e.g., action research). "

5953,Horrible workplace/lab environment during COVID... is this treatment normal??? Help!!,"If you feel this is unsafe to your participants, you have an ethical responsibility to report it to your school’s IRB. I’d recommend talking about this with your PI en masse first though, and perhaps talking with the Ombuds office too. But if you feel it’s unsafe, you need to keep your participants safe. Period.

Edit: can you alter the protocol to increase safety, for example meeting at the participant’s house instead of driving them there, and you stand outside the doorway while they partake inside? "
5954,"Those pursuing/intending to pursue a research career, how did you come to pick your niche?","Still a M.Sc. student here, but one of my post-doc friends told me to ""never fall in love for a specific project"". I guess switching fields is part of the business, because ultimately you have to adapt to the given conditions. "
5955,How do I get good at/comfortable with reading literature?,"I first read abstracts online and if they seem relevant I print them and then follow a similar reading flow as the earlier poster (lots of highlighting and notes). Also, anything I'm confused by or don't understand I get help with. I find moving past the fear of ""looking stupid"" opens up amazing opportunities to increase learning and comprehension. Everyone was new at some point, and one day you'll be able to pay it forward. "

5958,Prayer request for paper submission,
5959,Writing advice for my WWI paper,"While I am of course unaware of the sources you have marshaled, I can provide some conceptual suggestions. Levels of analysis can be used to analyze a battle. Look at the employment of tanks tactically, operationally and strategically in the three battles. Though--for World War I--you'll mainly be looking at tactical and organizational changes. By organizational changes I am referring to how the tanks were organized. *Why* and *how* did their employment within each battle change? Also: do your sources indicate any differences in how the different nation's employed their armor? Were the Germans learning and adapting to respond to attacks employing tanks? "
5960,Would PhD be a good idea for a person like me ?,"I decided to do a PhD with the intend of eventually going into industry. My advisor/PI was horrible. I had so much anxiety during my PhD in large part because my PI was manipulative and toxic and the way the lab operated was also toxic. If I went back in time knowing what that would be like, I would probably do it again even though is sucked really bad. In industry, you will advance farther in your career with a PhD compared to a BS or MS. I am currently a postdoc in industry. I do not feel isolated. My company has a postdoc program and all the postdocs on my site meet (now virtually) 1 time per week for various purposes. The vast majority of people I have heard of that did an industry postdoc left for a very well paying job either early or whenever their project was completed (2 year contract at my company). In my experience, academia was very political and no one was willing to do anything about scientific and ethical misconduct or mistreatment of employees if the person orchestrating these things had lots of grant money. I have not experienced any of this so far in my postdoc. I am currently as content as is possible when doing science under the current situation. "
5961,Going to completely fuck up my MSc thesis proposal and the relationship with my advisor,"We usually recycle parts of our courses projects to do our thesis proposal. Have you done some course work on your thesis subject?

Also, with covid, our uni gave us some slack with administrative deadlines. Can you ask to postpone the due date? "
5962,Should I try to get my PI to change my project?,"Yeah just tell your PI like you did in this post. My usual impression is they should check on your interest level from time to time, but sometimes they forget. If your group was low on funding from the get-go, it's your PI's problem (fault) and he should have considered that when admitting students. A good way out is to agree to transition the project to another student, or offer to apply for a fellowship for the first project. "
5963,What is the best grad school to go to?,"Ivy League isn't always the best - MIT and Caltech have better programs in a lot of areas, and if you're considering astrophysics, that's one of those areas. ""Better program"" isn't better for you - you need to find the school who has support for the research you want to do, professors with funding to do your research, and resources to complete your dissertation. If any one of these is deficient, the reputation of the university doesn't matter. "
5964,Suggestions on Research and Citation Organization / Software?,"Some of this depends on your area of STEM research. For instance, chemistry and biology don’t use LaTeX almost at all, so I wouldn’t recommend taking the time to learn it/put it in your workflow. 

Mine is ever evolving, but currently I write in either Scrivener (text/ideas for grants/papers), Word or Google Docs. 

Citations are via EndNote into word, and then final formatting is done in InDesign so I can pull in figures easily from Illustrator. 

For things that don’t need the final level of polish, I use the word version, especially if formatting is simple. 

I’ve tried other citation managers (Zotero, Mendeley, others) and found none of them completely replace what I can do in EndNote. I do maintain a Zotero library for my research group, since it’s free. It’s OK, but nothing that would make me want to switch.

A lot of my colleagues are completely skipping Word, and doing Google Docs straight to InDesign with DocsFlow. Makes collaboration easier. I’m not willing to pay the premium for the DocsFlow connection, personally- but I don’t do much collaborative writing at the moment. "
5965,Joining a research lab without any experience in research?,Definitely ask! Labs can always use the help. You have to start somewhere so don’t feel bad that you don’t have any experience.

5973,Those in their first year trying to find an advisor: how is your program handling spring rotations?,"Not sure how they would expect you to do a virtual rotation as a bio phd, but if that's really the case, I would consider deferring for a year.

I'm also starting my phd this year. Initially my start date was July 1st, but now it seems to have been pushed back to August 1st. I don't see them having us start our physical lab rotations any later than September/October. 

It helps that my program is at a medical research university, so they'll probably open up campus a lot earlier than most schools with undergrads. "

5976,Is it a meta-analysis if theres no statistical analysis?,"Literature reviews, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses are all different. Often times meta-analysis is conducted in the context of a systematic review. 

Meta-analysis, broadly defined, is a set of statistical techniques for aggregating the results of several studies.  Most commonly this refers to the fixed or random effects meta-analysis model. There are many free statistical software packages that allow for meta-analysis - my favorite is the metafor package in R. 

But it's not clear what exactly you are asking - or hoping to accomplish. Perhaps you can provide some more context so that someone can provide a more helpful answer? "
5977,How to remember proposed approach from many papers / journals ?,"Different field than yours, so I’m not sure how helpful this is, but I keep a spreadsheet of papers I read with columns for things like background, methods, major findings, limitations etc. I’ve found this to be the best way of keeping track of everything I read, and it’s super helpful when I’m writing papers later on, because if I remember an idea or a concept, I can easily go back and figure out what paper it was from. "
5978,"Hi all, Ive been offered the opportunity to apply for a placement, but not sure whether to...","From a US student perspective, I'd recommend it. Having diverse educational experiences is interesting to potential employers and increases the probability of getting interviews. It also gives you things to talk about in the interview. Also also, it will increase your connections, which is really important in the job search. "
5979,"For the grad students at Universities going online until further notice (and possibly closing down campus), how has it affected your lab and research?","Luckily the class I TA for was already a hybrid style, so lectures were already pre-recorded and hw and quizzes were already online.

5985,A vent about finishing my dissertation with incomplete data,"Hey, it can be hard to live up to your own expectations sometimes but at this stage bare minimum still translates to done! If you've got data and a committee flexible enough to see that it's something to defend on that's enough.

I came to the thread tonite to write a similar rant; my Phase II focus groups were scheduled for last week and were canceled due to COVID. Phase I survey data looks promising, but I still want the qualitative piece to round out the findings. Put in an expedited request to get IRB permission to try them through zoom. All my committee chair has to add is concerns about technology and reliability concerns. Well fuck that. I'm putting the groups online and collecting what I can. 

Take what you've got and finish if you can! I'm finishing to spite my chair at this point, it's as fine a motivator as any. I was babbling about a defense to my dog on our walk tonite and can't wait to try online focus groups. Bring it fucking on. "
5986,"When writing your papers, how do *you* prefer to include excerpts that contain citations?","English major here, perhaps I can help you out. If I’m understanding your question correctly, you have a source within a source that you want to cite. For cases like this, you might write:

According to John Smith, “The best day of the week is Monday” (quoted in Johnson 12). 

In this case, “John Smith” is the author whose words you would like to use, and “Johnson 12” is the author who wrote John Smith’s words in the piece you are reading. 

I hope this helped! "
5987,How do you deal with edits to a manuscript by your advisor without drowning your inner voice in it?,"There are countless different ways to write a manuscript. One person might deem certain information unnecessary, while another person finds it important to include. Save older versions of everything. Don't just delete entire sections and then save over them with new changes. Hopefully the parts you wrote that the reviewer is asking for are still saved somewhere and you can include them in the edited manuscript. 

Editing is a collaborative process. If you get a comment/edit you do not agree with, ask your advisor to elaborate, and explain to them why you included it in the first place. Have you tried doing that? This is the best way to learn and improve your scientific writing. "
5988,"After working for about a month on a key part of my paper, I found out that the results show no meaningful conclusions at all :D","Have you considered any lag or delayed response variables (if appropriate, you might consider if there is a delayed response in a system registering a change in your dependent/predictor variables if you don't assume an immediate/simultaneous response in y with changes in x)? I'm assuming you're examining power (as an energy source, as opposed to social power), so you might consider if/how any surplus energy is stored or used during sudden unexpected climatic/weather changes which might impact your relationship between demand on energy systems in response to those events (if any of those changes/events might generate surplus energy or if there was a stored supply to draw upon to help meet sudden demands). You might also consider if there were large-scale infrastructure projects (sudden growth or expansion in a system/part of a system because someone wanted to build a new factory somewhere and needed the power for it) or prolonged outages unrelated to your variables of interest (car/helicopter accident took out a power line) that might be skewing your metrics.

5993,Can I be held accountable for data I generated that is unethically manipulated by someone else?,"Wow, this is an incredibly tough situation. I’m sorry to hear you did not have a good time with your advisor.

Personally I think that you should give him the data. I assume 1. You will report them regardless of whether you give it or not. 2. Any type of research on the data YOU did was ethical, and by this I mean that whether the information given to you was fabricated or not, your results would still be the same. 3. If they did publish the results, it is because they want positive light on them. If you do not agree with their findings and said you don’t want to be a part of a publishing, they will most likely not put you on. It would look bad if an author came out and said you know your own work is fake, and also if they are already unethical, they see no harm in taking some extra credit for your hard work. 

Not giving it to him will cause more problems that you do not need as you have a new job and do not plan on pursuing a PhD (?), giving the potential that the previous advisor could bring up that you refused to give data back with no other explanation. 

I hope this is a little helpful, but I’ve never been in this situation so I don’t have firsthand experience. Sorry. "

5996,Disheartening rejection of papers,"That super sucks. I hope you can take some well-deserved time to be frustrated and eat all the desserts (or exercise or something if you're healthier than me). 

Science and Nature are fickle due their prestige monopoly and sheer volume of high quality submissions I think. I had an article at Science receive a very positive review with only minor criticisms (like a small typographical error in an equation and preference for a particular term of art) that concluded with: ""This is a great article, and will be published in a great journal, but not in Science."" The article was indeed rejected. 

Nat Nuero still has a great impact factor and readership though, so I'm sure it would be a great vehicle to help disseminate the work. Godspeed. "
5997,Advice for preparations for a lockdown?,"Make sure you don't start anything significant in terms of lab work, anything that takes longer than two days (48 hours) should be avoided. You can still set up experiments that take months but you do need to make sure that they are safe to be left alone for a month or two. 

Wrap existing lab work as soon as you can. Compile results and upload them to cloud drive.

6008,"Internet is not giving me a clear answer, need assistance with an APA citation, I am trying to cite data from a conference presentation I found but the presenter is not listed in the slides, how would I properly cite such a thing?","Try looking for the conference program with abstracts.  A university library might have it, or you may be able to find it online archived from the conference.  Usually they’re sent out ahead of a conference, and will have the conference schedule, events, registration forms, and abstracts. "
6009,I couldn't decide whether my advisor asking my permission or she is being considerete before giving my project to another student.,I think you should ask your advisor to clarify whether she is asking you or telling you.  Basically stop trying to guess what they are thinking and just ask them what they are thinking. Talk to them. 
6010,F31 application score is in and it wasn’t discussed,"Having a solid proposal is only step one.  As previously mentioned, the rest of the review process is up to a myriad of factors unrelated to the quality of your proposal. 

Don't beat yourself up, rejection is the norm in academia. Review, adjust, and resubmit next cycle. "
6011,Side projects,"My side projects are what saved me when my main projects all failed spectacularly. Having multiple projects going when you first start is the best way to go, in my opinion. They were all sort of related, in that the lab had the expertise to do them, but differed in many ways too.

For project management, I keep a notebook at my desk where I write out my to-do list every evening before leaving lab for the next day. I also keep a running list of ideas/experiments/commitments in a word doc on my computer of everything I'll have to do at some point for my projects. If I'm not sure what to do the next day, I consult the list and start working towards 2-3 of the items listed there. When things got super busy a year or so ago, I would also make a rough sketch of what I wanted to get done over the next few weeks. "
6012,Has anyone done a non-systematic review as part of a thesis chapter for your Master's or PhD?,
6013,Feeling of unpreparedness,"Ime this is pretty normal; we get into grad school and we often feel like we’re meant to already be prepared, polished experts. Take a deep breath and remind yourself that you are a STUDENT. You’re there to learn. If you already knew everything you wouldn’t need to be there. You’ll have to muddle your way through (and fuck up) some protocols before you really know what you’re doing — so try to go easy on yourself, and don’t let your anxiety about it delay you from diving into the research and making your first mistakes so you can learn from them. "
6014,How long did it take you guys to feel like you belonged in your program? Or does the imposter syndrome never go away?,"It took me a solid year to feel comfortable  in my program, and I’ve only really started feeling more confident this year (3rd year). I find it helpful to focus on evidence that I am not a bad student (e.g., nice comment from a prof, A on a paper, whatever). Most people also eventually shift toward accepting good-enough work (instead of the undergrad tendency to want perfect work and grades). 

Be kind to yourself. It is hard to move across the country and change your whole life. It has only been a few months and anyone would struggle with the adjustment! "
6015,How to Start Preparing For a PhD?,My advice would be to apply for PhD programs (perhaps in communication or organizational communication?). Look for faculty who research similar topics. It doesn't need to be an exact match--you need someone you can work with. Then save as much money as you can and relax as much as you can.

6019,Opening access to scientific journals,"I don’t know if it’s interesting to you or others, but we kinda solved (?) the problem in astronomy, or avoided it entirely.

It seems like most fields just submit papers to journals that then throw them behind paywalls. Astro journals do the same thing, but we also upload a plain (ie without journal-specific formatting) version of *every* paper to the arXiv. It’s not even really a choice anymore, it’s the cultural norm, so practically all papers are open-access of sorts. Even when I’m on campus and can get past the journal paywalls, I still exclusively go through arXiv because it’s way easier to search since it has everything in it. The records go back to the 1300’s or something. Old papers have been scanned in. 

It’s a little weird that the journals all just accept that we do this... but I guess if they tried to make us stop, we just wouldn’t use that journal anymore. "

6027,Feedback on Manuscript Feels Superficial,"I hate to say it, but it might be best to let this one off the hook, at least for now. This project will be just the first step towards hopefully many many more. And you're likely to have things go wrong and have to set down ideas and progress again in the future. Many many undergrads don't publish their REU work. The purpose of these sorts of programs is less to produce publishable research and more to give undergrads a taste of what research is like. If your advisor thinks the field study isn't publishable, he's probably right. Which doesn't mean it was a failure. It means you learned a lot and your field research will be better once you start your PhD field work. Maybe you can use the unpublished findings to apply for funding to do it better once you have the time down the line. But from the sounds of it, publishing it as a stand alone piece by the end of the summer might not be in the cards. "

6030,"When judging whether a PI is a good scientist, which parameter from the google scholar is the most important","Citation record is not really related to how good of a mentor someone is.  Often your mega-PIs with huge h-indexs are going to be far to busy with their 20 postdocs and numerous speaking engagements to pay attention to one of the graduate students they have.  h-index is a decent indicator of the PI's impact in the field, but says absolutely nothing about how good of a mentor they are going to be.

That said its not like a low h-index means the PI is an engaged and capable mentor either.  Honestly an online index is not what you want, you want to get in contact with someone in their lab and ask them what its like to work for the PI.    


Also the thing that is really critical is if you are interested in the specific research that lab is conducting.  You aren't going to be in a good relationship with the PI if you aren't all that interested in what their focus is.  I assume that goes without saying but going to say it anyways. "
6031,Thoughts on using text-to-speech programs to review literature?,"I do this with court cases and particularly arduous readings and it helps. 

It’s especially useful when I’m handwriting my notes. If I’m typing it’s probably better for retention to read and type on another monitor. 

Also I’m studying for the cpa and I’ve found that using the auditory notes while writing is more efficient than reading the book and writing. "
6032,Failed Dissertation Defense: Need help with writing resources,"Hi! I think I would call it a ""dissertation coach"" or ""tutor"" not a writer. I get what you're saying about wanting help with your writing process and someone to guide you and that can be totally fine. You want to avoid the word writer though because that makes it sound like someone will do the work for you, which can count as cheating.

I'm sorry you have to do your paper again. How long is your timeframe this time around? It sounds like your paper may not have been terrible but that your presentation and paper didn't line up, is that right? My first step would be to talk to my advisor about next steps: rewriting the paper from scratch? Rewriting the presentation? Rewriting both to have the same theme? You could loop in an editor in these talks, too, but I wouldn't hire an editor to do any work until you know you're on the right track because you don't want to perfect a paper that you're just going to have to re-write.

I'm a dissertation editor with about 10 years of experience. I would be happy to provide you with a quote and a sample edit but I would be hesitant to do much without seeing the comments on both your paper and your presentation. I'd also want to make sure we had a solid plan going forward and would hope that your advisor could be looped in on the plan or reviewing each chapter, because I wouldn't want you to waste a bunch of money and turn in a nice paper that would just be rejected because of content. We can talk about what to include and work on strategies for writing and organizing but there's only so much help I can offer with content, since my expertise is in clarity, commas, and cohesiveness (and APA style, and semicolons and blah blah blah) not arts education. I can point out areas that don't make sense and make sure you follow a theme and prove points... anyways, if you're interested, let me know. Other good places to find editors are the Editorial Freelance Association or ACES The Society for Editing. There are some other associations as well. What's nice about those is that the members are usually at least lightly vetted for editing experience so you know you'll get an experienced member and you can search for experts in certain types of editing, like academic/dissertation editing and some might even have an arts focus. "
6033,Writing skills SOS,"Read publications to get a better feel for what the ultimate goal of your writing is. Ask your PI if they can do a journal club for your lab. That way you'll learn how to critique articles and can also write up some literature reviews in the mean time. The best thing to do is practice and learn the diction and style of scientific writing. If your PI isn't willing to do a journal club, other grad students in your department who are also having the same struggles might be willing to form a journal club. "
6034,How to find PIs?,"I'd recommend you to seriously consider whether you want to graduate school. Graduate school is RESEARCH, not activism. "
6035,Anyone have recommendations for programs/websites to track sources with APA 7th ed. citation style?,"I used PERRLA in undergrad and grad school. It can work with Microsoft word, but they also have an online text editor. I think at the time it was $50/year. "
6036,Any time management advice for writing papers?,"analysis and results (with figures), discussion, then methods and intro. at least this is my usual plan of attack for everything, from lab reports to thesis work. "
6037,MSW/MPH student: Thinking about publishing?,">presentations at professional conferences — now I am interested in publishing.

My follow up question would be whether these two are directly connected. Is it ideas/data you have already presented in a conference setting that you are hoping to flesh out in a journal publication? "
6038,Is it too early to switch advisors if I just finished my first semester as a master's student?,"Nope! but just keep in mind each switch might add time to your thesis. 

&#x200B;

I did switch advisers 3 days after saying yes to my first one though, sometimes its that buyers remorse that tells you if it was the right or wrong choice. Not the ideal way to find out but my current adviser is great and I don't regret making the switch. "
6039,My advisor has pushed me in the wrong direction,"Just do what you want to do. At this point you’re the expert on your research and its best direction

Edit: in response to dissenting opinions... my assumption is that OP can competently present and make a logical case for the research direction intended that would persuade the PI. If that can’t be done then the research direction intended isn’t strong enough. "
6040,Looking to Recruit Postgraduate Students for Study of Experience with Online Postgraduate Education Programs,
6041,Independent research study?,
6042,Keeping up with many projects or focus on one,"One paper is better than no papers. No one is going to know about the other projects once you leave (unless other students continue them, and even then it’s not a guarantee you’ll get authorship). But if you push out a paper during your master’s you’ll have eternal proof of the work you did. It could give you an edge for PhD programs, but also future jobs. "
6043,MS in Finance looking for your opinions regarding a thesis topic,
6044,Question: How do you go about understanding complex models/math you've never seen before?,"Decided to dive a little more into the specifics, since I'm bored and this sounds interesting.

At a quick glance, I found [Tikhonov 2017](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12723) which appears to be a methods paper that introduces a lot of concepts and notation and may be necessary reading for understanding the later papers. I also found [Tikhonov 2019](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecy.2929) which is about scaling the method to work with very large data, and [Tikhonov 2019](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/603217v1.abstract) on BioRxiv introducing an R package for fitting this kind of model.

Which of these papers are you looking at? Are you working in R or in MATLAB? What are your current questions you need help with? "
6045,"Paper got rejected, and unsurprisingly I'm questioning my entire PhD","Keep going, friend. If there are thousands of submissions, there are hundreds (or thousands) of journals, and one of them *will* publish your paper, even if it's a little outdated. You can even modify the paper between submissions to slightly re-frame the contributions that it offers within dynamic research contexts. "
6046,Overview of research brief?,"Different fields of study and different professors may have different ideas about what that means. It is okay to ask for more details about what should be included, but ultimately it’s a persuasion piece with the goal of convincing your superiors that this is research they should support.

My best guess would be:
1) Aims of the study - what are you trying find out?
2) the big “so what?” Why is it important to find that out? Does it add to the current dialogue in your field? Is there some important real-life way that information can be used?
3) small lit review - put your research in context of current theory and studies.
4) methods - how will you do the study.
5) implications - the final sell, talking about the potential impact of what you guess your findings will be. "
6047,Crossover between Computer Science and Business,"In finance there are a lot of papers coming out using machine learning or natural language processing techniques to gather data. For example there are papers looking at the tone of language used in annual reports on firms following year profitability.  Additionally papers in  financial economics (or any top econ papers) tend to require more data wrangling skills than some of the papers seen in finance. 

Also, I think finance and accounting can come off as more mathematically rigorous but the intuition behind them is much simpler than the math behind concepts in CS. "
6048,Where do you find cool PowerPoint templates?,Carnival Slides! 
6049,I think I may have found my ideal lab! Is there anything else I need to consider?,"It seems like it's a good fit for you, and it's great you were able to find it. I overheard someone give a first year some advice that I found to be interesting and something I had not thought of. Are there students who rotated in this lab but didn't actually join? See if you can reach out to them and ask why they didn't join. If it was simply because another lab was a better fit, then you're probably good to go if the rest of your rotation works out. If red flags come up, then those are things you should consider. 

Best of luck. "
6050,Being railroaded by a territorial peer-reviewer,"Eh. The editor knows who the reviewer is, and if they're just shilling for their own papers to be cited it'll get caught now that you've brought it to their attention.

There's nothing inherently wrong with pointing out that you may have missed some good citations. Or that your work has already been done elsewhere. But this is clearly out of line.

We once had a reviewer trash all of the published experimental data that we used to validate a model. Data that as well cited by others, came from multiple sources/labs, and spanned 30+ years. Firm response to the reviewer and a note to the editor and it was no problem. We took it as funny. "
6051,Mental cost of publishing papers during PhD.,Did he not submit presubmission inquiries to these journals? Usually the editors will give a pretty good idea of whether the manuscript is worth the initial submission. Could save you a lot of time in the future.

6059,How can I become a better researcher?,"Honestly, start asking your PI. Unless they are really cranky, most PI’s are happy to help their students learn. That’s part of their job, after all. They will know the field best, which can help you prioritize what you read and/or learn. "

6061,Laboratory tips?,**At the Bench** by Kathy Barker is a great book that covers most of your concerns. It will help you get a general idea about what is expected of you and what the standard practices are in an academic lab. 
6062,At what point do you decide that you've researched enough?,"I found it helpful to read a few papers that are closely related (like, 3-5 usually), and then I had enough knowledge to at least create a broad outline of the paper. Creating the outline helped me figure out which areas I needed to know more about or in a more detailed way. That process helped a lot with breaking ""researching/writing"" down into much more manageable tasks. Like, instead of my to-do list saying ""read more papers about children's writing,"" I had a bunch of items that were like, ""find out when children have good enough motor skills to form letters"" and ""read more about the role of reading comprehension in early writing"". Sometimes when I sit down to write, I still get to a point where I needed to find a reference or two for a point I want to make mid-paragraph, but that felt much more manageable to me than just figuring out when I know ""enough"" to start writing. "
6063,Computer-based transcriptions: too good to be true?,"I've only used Transcribe, but my experience is that 1) it gives you a really good head start but 2) it's still going to need a lot of human work to fix it up. Services I've used probably saved me about half the time it would have taken to transcribe manually. Again, this is with cheap online apps, so YMMV. 

I would be skeptical of any service that claimed to accurate auto-translate Tagalog, but that's just speculation. "
6064,What to do with postdoc that I am collaborating with?,
6065,How to Support a Friend Who Might be in a Position to be Taken Advantage of?,"You're the type of awesome friend that I want to always have. I think you should tell her what you think, but people make their own choices, good or bad, and it's beyond your control. I know I've personally made bad choices before against the good advice of other people. Your friend will be okay no matter what she decides. Even if this new lab turns out to be exploitive, she has the skills and resourcefulness to survive it and do well, and she'll learn a couple of things from it that she wouldn't have otherwise. "
6066,Only a small number of people actually care about your research.,I think that you can also get other people interested in it if it matters to you. I was studying a relatively unusual phenomenon in turtles and ended up giving tons of public talks about it during my masters.

6073,"What are the low cost, online grad schools?","You don't mention a discipline, and some of the programs you're asking about are professional programs (MBA), not graduate programs. 

You've also tagged this ""research"", but it doesn't seem related to research?

In general, MBA programs are something you should go into after working 3-5 years, not right after graduation. 

Also in general, most online graduate programs are not worth it. "
6074,"After 5 years, I feel no closer to graduation. I’ve produced an enormous amount of negative data. My PI throws me under the bus to my committee and, without offering me any advice or direction, will be the first one to say, ‘I told you so.’","Are you required to publish to graduate? If not, stop worrying about it. (It will look better if you can publish, but there's no point in accumulating stress about it unless you are required to do so.)

Do you have enough statistical power in your data to claim negative results? Convincingly demonstrating that something does not work is difficult, but valuable, even if people don't get excited about it.

My program generally advises people to stay a year or two longer if it yields a PhD or an additional publication; the post-doc clock starts immediately, and is limited by universities and major funding institutions in my field to prevent interminable post-docs.

I also have a complicated, messy data set without crystal clear results.

I am struggling with how to build a dissertation out of what I have. I have learned that one's dissertation need not be ""publishable"" although that does make the process easier. It does have to be based on the work of the author (as in, one cannot staple in a 4th author publication, but the contribution to that work can be incorporated).

I was recently able to get my PI's attention and discuss what the chapters of my dissertation might look like, and he provided some useful insights. He indicated that writing up what I have spent my time on is a viable option, even if it is not publishable (or not publishable in a high class journal, or is only publishable in a methodological journal). We are supposed to be learning how to independently conduct research, so the lack of feedback is somewhat expected, but you might find it helpful to speak to others who have graduated, take a thesis workshop, etc.

My department coordinator set up a meeting with me to help me find resources to graduate. Maybe your department can also help you find guidance outside your committee.

An overly ambitious project that I can show is technically feasible will become a technical chapter in my dissertation; I plan to explain how one could actually do the project by modifying some aspects of the design to greatly speed up the data collection process. I spent a lot of time on this, but it just didn't yield a scientific result because the project was poorly designed. Ironically, my PI's attitude towards this project changed from enthusiastic to negative over time, but he still wants me to include it.

Although I get very frustrated and negative about my situation at times, I keep trying to remind myself of positive interpretations. My data was collected under inconsistent circumstances beyond my control, which is less than ideal. However, whatever I do find should be fairly robust due to that inconsistency. Also during this analysis and result-searching process, I continue to learn new and interesting things, which is something I enjoy (despite being annoyed that I would prefer not to conduct science this way). Furthermore, as I am interested in maybe pursuing data science as a career, finding a few useful stories in my data seems like a valuable training exercise, which will make a good story about overcoming adversity and finding value in a mess for later.

One student in my program discovered after 5 years, that all his data was noise due to faulty equipment. He graduated 2 years later after even more research without the noise problems, although his mental health suffered a lot.

As a last resort, you might be able to reform your committee and even switch labs and get a new mentor. After an advisor in my program basically ruined the life of his nearly finished grad student (by abruptly rescinding the position, and therefore the visa, of this student's lover roommate and fellow lab mate), this student was allowed to transfer to another lab and finish. Rebuilding the committee is a fairly nuclear option, but it might be possible (although you mentioned below that this might be problematic -- at my school in this circumstance, the recommendation is to speak to the dean of students, who hopefully is not an old drinking buddy of your PI).

You might also write a draft of a paper and give it to the PI. Publishing more is better, and it is harder to say no to a manuscript than a nebulous plan. Finding famous people who have published things in less-than-stellar journals might also lubricate the process, in case your PI's ego is in the way of a lower tier publication.

A workshop I attended suggested looking up dissertations from prior lab members. This can provide an idea of what the PI considers acceptable for graduation. (If you have never read a dissertation before, it is worth doing. Some of them are surprisingly rough.) We have a ProQuest database of dissertations on our campus. "
6075,How do you keep notes with your advisor?,"I currently use a shared Google Doc/Drive which has worked well so far. Dropbox also for sharing papers/comments on papers, but its basically same set up "

6079,Preparations for Thesis Writing,Get your writing station set up in such a way that you WANT to be there for hours at a time. Consider the ergonomics while doing so. Block out time in your schedule and put your phone on silent. Stock up on snacks! Don't forget to sleep or shower. Take breaks to rest your eyes and stretch. Follow down leads of potential papers through the reference lists. Stay on top of your formatting from the first minute so that you don't have to go back through at the end and waste time tidying it up! 
6080,Receving payment for an hourly RA position,"Do you have to report funding to your department? Our department requires us to fill out an advising form at the end of each term which includes questions on RA/TA/PA positions and what percent our FTE is aka what sort of funding we have. If yes, you can always explain to her that you need to know more about compensation to report to your department. 

Otherwise just say you're concerned about budget for next semester and would like to know if there will be compensation for your position otherwise you have to go through the loan process, etc. 

I am both a PA and lab manager so I have either used or heard both of these reasons and have had positive outcomes! It's very possible that your PI is just stressed due to the end of the semester, it being grant season (at least for some of the smaller, but still significant grants, in field), and other students asking for recommendations for grad school, etc. and just forgot, as bad as that sounds. "
6081,Paper just rejected (again),Pray alot harder 
6082,Is co-mentorship harder to maintain?,"I'm being co-mentored and it can be awkward to navigate in terms of communication and levels of interaction, but it can also be really beneficial and expose you to different research groups and topics. Just make sure your mentors have a good working relationship. And make sure there are regular meetings with all three of you! "

6084,Just submitted my thesis to my advisor,"My adviser asked me to have my first draft done for the start of May, and I sent it to him two weeks ago and hadn't heard a peep so I emailed him to confirm he got it. He replied saying he has three other things still ahead of me on his priority list, and he hopes to take a look at it next week.

/sigh. I wonder what it's like to have an adviser who cares. "
6085,A bit of a garble about advisors after graduation and a small FYI,"In a vacuum, what they are doing is completely reasonable and what I would expect from a PI. If the lab has a project that generated data and the PI wants to publish, he can just write up the manuscript on his own. Since you obviously did a lot of work on it the PI is right to credit you as an author. If you dont believe in the data or the project you would need to decline authorship.

There are clearly a ton of other problems with this PI but I dont think this is one of them. "
6086,How did you ‘make’ it?,"It helps to remember that published papers are the result of months/years of work by multiple people, who often have decades of combined experience. Paper ideas are often years in the making, and then the paper will be further shaped by coauthors, editors, peer reviewers, etc. As an individual just starting out in the field, you're really not expected to come close to this level of expertise yet. "
6087,Grant writing - never done it before. Resources appreciated!,"How will your work benefit society? How will your work benefit the existing literature and your field? If you can clearly articulate answers to those two questions, you should be okay! "
6088,To what extent did your supervisor help you write your thesis?,"Depends on the field, as co-authors are common in some.

My advisor pointed out grammar and spelling mistakes. He also asked me about parts of the text which were unclear, or needed further citations, and suggested some bibliography at the beginning. 

He was mostly interested in my ability to defend my point of view (with proper proof), which I really appreciated. We did disagree on some topics, but he encouraged me to challenge him and to see my mistakes for myself rather that laying them out for me. "

6094,History conference abstract,"So...start with answering those guideline points individually until you're satisfied. Order them in a way that makes sense, writing in the necessary transitions. 

Then prepare to say goodbye, and cut it all down to the word limit, usually 200-250 words. 

The key is knowing what exactly you plan your paper to be about, and why it's important, which is built upon you making some claim about the existing historiography - so know that to the extent necessary to be confident in your assertion. Include only the barest of necessary details - it's very tempting to include everything you think shows of you know the topic well. Be succinct, precise, and concise, as they say. "
6095,Will the research activity during my Master's program seriously impact my PhD or career path?,"Well, tbf I am also in a similar kind of situation. I would like to do my research in Computer Vision and Deep Learning but I have got an offer for NLP in a project I am not that interested. "
6096,"Just told we might not be paid for a month or longer, but still expected to perform all contract duties. Anyone else dealing with this?",Reach out to a local lawyer who specializes in employment law. Make sure you understand exactly what is going on and what your options are; don’t rely solely on what the university or your PI or whoever says. But also don’t tell the university or officials what you’re speaking with a lawyer until after the fact. A lawyer will be able to advise you further. 
6097,How do you survive grad school financially?,"You gotta get funding somehow and do work in the summertime. Take advantage of EVERYTHING and I mean **EVERYTHING.** Go to events to get food/network and apply for everything you can without driving yourself insane. For me, grad school requires you to be constantly engaged in everything you do everyday. Its nonstop if I'm being honest. Maybe in the summer its not so bad but during the school year its go go go. "

Keep in mind that if you travel or fly around alot you may want to get additional health insurance. University insurance tends to be restrictive to just hospitals in the area, though they should cover a share of emergency expenses anywhere in the us. "
6100,How common is it to not have health insurance provided?,Is that a MS? PhD? PhD programs typically include health insurance. I could see a MS program cutting corners. 
6101,"Already accepted one offer of MS with no funding, but a second school just offered me MS + scholarship --- what do I do? Is it wrong to double back on an acceptance?","Hello!

I went to WPI for my undergrad so I have some mixed feedback I can offer. I also studied biomedical engineering so I’m not as familiar with the robotics program, although I know it is highly regarded both internally and externally. With regard to the curriculum at WPI I can say they absolutely do a great job of teaching you real and applicable skills that will make you stand out from graduates at other schools when you rejoin the work force. After WPI I went to brown for my ms and I had far more practical lab skills than some of my peers from other schools. 

At the same time, the graduate program is simply not a priority at WPI. All of the aspects that sets them apart are focused on the undergrad experience. I also know they are going through a bit of turmoil right now with their president and the treatment of professors with many having already quit and others searching for jobs because the school is in massive debt to fund its seemingly annual expansion projects. 

That being said, the name also carries clout in the field of robotics (I believe they were the first school in the country to offer a robotics program) and especially in New England. They also have a strong alumni network in the area and in my experience higher ups in companies from WPI love to hire WPI graduates. Although the same can probably be said for NEU. 

I hope this was helpful and didn’t add even more to you confusion! In terms of going back on your acceptance, don’t worry about it. You have to do what’s best for you. You’ll lose your deposit but if you think you’ll be happier in Boston with your network of friends then I’d say it’s worth it. 

Best of luck! And congrats on your acceptances! "
6102,Better to take longer with less debt or finish more quickly and earn more?,"I transferred out of my previous university, where I'd be finishing my master's right now, to a university where it'll take me double the time to graduate and I don't regret it.

6103,1st year PhD student. Should I stay with a 3rd year and a third potential roommate for 650-800 a month or alone for 990-1200 a month?,"Roommate as in sharing a room?

You need a place where you can be alone to drown yourself in misery in the long hours of the night while finishing that paper that should've been done a month ago.

And with an undergrad no less, have you got no pride? *shakes head*

Maybe give it a try but ensure you can change the arrangement if you feel it's not working for you. As in don't sign a contract in blood saying you'll stay for one full year before being able to leave (or kick the other creature out). "

6111,Are Graduate Assistantships Feasible For A Masters Student?,"The general rule of thumb (for math degree) is, you won’t find TA/RA in top 30 schools. Once you go down the rank to top 50-100, there are quite a few schools who offers funded Master program (waived tuition+a small stipend that covering living expense)

I myself did a funded master this way. Pm if you want to discuss (probably need to know which state you prefer to give you narrowed down suggestions) "
6112,I worked 5 jobs last year. I made a total of 26k,That's capitalism for you. Ditch academia. 
6113,How available is need-based financial aid for Master's of Public Health programs in the US?,I got a workstudy position as part of my offer for my MPH. It was not large. I ended up taking out a loan. 
6114,"Money, loans, tuition advice","This year I was only offered loans due to a shortage of funded positions for my clinical doctorate degree. This year I only took out loans for the exact amount I needed for tuition. I work part time to cover about half of my monthly expenses and then I use my savings account for the other half. This has worked pretty well for me. I also have a roommate and I’m relatively frugal with spending, but I still will go out and have fun I just watch my spending. I do want to point out that the year before I had funding (and saved money from my stipend each month) and next year I’ll have funding so that is something to consider with my approach. "
6115,Breakdown of what I'm paying for in Tuition,Your ‘tuition’ is the cost of the credits that you’re taking. It’s how much that school and program costs to be enrolled in X number of credit hours. My university also calls ‘tuition’ “instructional fees” if you look at a breakdown of student tuition and fees by credit hour 
6116,"Hiring freeze, funding and the pandemic.","Definitely not worth 45k of your own money, although the university certainly wouldn’t mind if you did that (given their upcoming budget shortfall due to COVID).

Take a gap year if you can’t get funded. "
6117,How did you pay for your masters program/grad school? (Trying to figure out how to fund this!),"Are you paid for lab time? Teaching classes ? Unless you’re 100% sure to land a veryyyyy good job ($$$) at the end of your studies, it’s a bad idea to take a loan for gradschool :/

6118,"If you are a poor grad student, you can file your taxes for free with TurboTax",r/personalfinance has a running thread about tax filing resources.

6120,Does anyone know anything about GA jobs and unemployment?,
6121,How hard is it to live in/near Central LA on my PhD stipend?,"You probably cant afford it, very few students can without help. I worked with UCLA grad students one summer and a few UCLA PhDs, all of them said not to apply there because its too expensive. Need more evidence? Loom at the strikes going on in the UC system. If you got another offer at a comparable university with lower cost of living, I wouldn't even consider this offer. "
6122,What's the probability of having my PhD funding package cancelled if I've already accepted their offer?,"I believe a lot of the rescinding is happening for state universities. This is because of budget cuts that are needed at the state level because of COVID19. So I believe funding packages are getting cancelled because these are schools where the state is saying “hey we are cutting the budget we give you by 10 or 20% this year”.
I would hope they wouldn’t pull an already offered funding, but who knows. I imagine students throughout the country will see tuition increases to try to offset this budget cut as well "
6123,When did your PI tell you if you’re getting a stipend or not?,I straight up asked both of my potential PI’s what it would be. It’s important information and you should know before you commit. I’m also applying for MS programs (although I should note that I have to go that route before I start a PhD in the same program. Transitioning is easy) 
6124,Is it necessary to go into debt to go to grad school?,"So I feel like this really has lots of layers. One thing to consider is for graduate education federal need based grants (Pell-grant) isn’t an option. I believe it is possible to not go into debt, if you are in a program that provides assistantships with tuition waivers and stipends. If not it definitely is possible to have minimal debt, by working and applying for outside scholarships. I have loans for undergrad and grad school but I kept them at a minimum and each time I take out a loan I have calculated what percentage of my monthly salary (with a starting salary) will go towards said loans. I’ve kept that monthly payment very doable to still save money etc. I have loans and it sucks but also for my degree I need to go to grad school and funded positions for multiple years can be few and far between so loans were just a reality. "
6125,How does PhD funding work?,"This 100% depends on your PhD program. For mine, admittance is technically not the same as approval for funding, but the chances of being admitted but not meeting the requirements for funding were insanely low. Typically either your advisor can fund you or you’re automatically submitted for funding through the university. There are other, outside funding sources that you can apply for (NSF GRFP is the most common I’ve heard of) but usually you would do that before applying to grad school in the first place. My PhD was in psych in the US so this might all be specific to my area, you’ll have to check with students in your field to be sure. "
6126,Rent/Stipend ratio?,"Also, ask current graduate students in your program where they live. They have already gone through this with the same stipend, and I can guarantee you between the lot have found the cheapest places to live. "
6127,Is it ethical to be seeking other positions in case my transitional internship is cancelled?,"It's not illegal, and given the circumstances, recommended. This is your life, future, and savings. Don't risk you cash reserves while facing down a recession. "
6128,Average funding for MSc STEM students in Canada?,"Average funding for MSc students in Canada ? From my experience : 0$ 
I suppose you have above average grades if they offer you entrance awards. And if you made the department list before entering the master , you have very good chances to receive Nserc. Be aware your specific situation is not common. 

From another experience : money is not everything. I know some people who chose their University by how much they received for funding, and regretted it later. Choose wisely, choose a good lab and a good teacher with whom you have a good vibe. I’ve known too many people who left their Master because they had a bad experience with their advisor, even if they received a lot of money.

6129,Should I take out private student loans for going to graduate school full time?,"Good God no.

Federal loans only.  And only if you have either the projected income to make them work or are planning on entering pubic service. "
6130,Scholarship taken away mid-semester (Did nothing wrong) - Can they do this and what are my options?,Did you have this scholarship last semester? Does your school offer funding for grad students? 
6131,Health insurance,">Is this a good sign for the program and how do people people survive without health insurance?

It's often out of the hands of the actual program. That's more of a university-level decision. 

Really, you have to consider the cost of living. If you are getting 30k and rent should be less thank 1k.... that's likely easy. If you are moving to a costly area ::cough:: UCLA ::cough::, well.... good luck. You would need additional reassurances to ensure the next 4-6 years are comfortable. Living with a bunch of room mates and eating nothing but Ramen noodles isn't going to cut it for me. "
6132,NSF GRFP and taxes,"Been a few years for me, but when I had it I treated it as cash income, with an “SCH” note to the side of it. This meant no withholding, so I filed quarterly. 

You could also just pay the underpayment penalty at the end of the year. "
6133,Managing finances as PhD?,You have guaranteed funding and applied for fellowships...? There are students out there without guaranteed funding that need those fellowships. This system is so broken. 
6134,Let’s talk debt,"Its not really about debt its about the interest rate on that debt.  If you get and lock in some student level low APR loan then debt isn't that big of a deal, even if the number is big.  You end up with 100,000 debt but you have a 2% fixed APR then you are talking about paying $2k a year on your loan.  The salary difference you get from the degree should more than cover that.

A lot of people seem super concerned by debt or rush to pay off their debt as soon as they can.  But if you can lock in a low interest rate then debt is more of an investment really, its not such a bad thing.  I think when people think about debt they are picturing the crippling credit card debt situation where its like 29% APR and it piles up faster than you can dig out...but student loans typically are not like that. "
6135,Leaving underemployed job with benefits for graduate school.,Have you spoken to the student services department at your graduate school? Student status (full-time or part-time) is often tied to eligibility for certain programs. 
6136,What does a GA position entail financially?,"This can only be answered by your university. GA stipends and tuition waivers vary widely. My school is unionized so all graduate appointments (RA, TA, GA) get the same package: monthly stipend and tuition waivers. However, at University of California campuses, GAs don’t get tuition waivers when RAs do. 

I randomly googled BU graduate assistantships and there’s a full list of job descriptions posted online. It seems some of them specifically state “8 units tuition remission” and a $10k stipend over the school year, although I don’t know what they mean about “remission”. 

https://www.bu.edu/fitrec/about/graduate-assistantships/

Feel free to explore yourself, but definitely call around to your department and to whoever handles graduate funding. Also try to talk to current grad students about the funding situation — they’re more likely to be honest with you. "
6137,How much of stipend to spend on housing?,Lol I spend 80% on housing and utilities and eat ramen the rest of the time. 
6138,What's the difference between a fellowship and an RA/TA position?,"Fellowships, in my experience, don't come with any expectation that you will do work for them. With a TA/RA position, you're either teaching or researching for x (usually 20) hours per week to ""earn"" your money, while fellowships are just money given to you. It's possible that the fellowship you're being told to apply for comes with tuition remission and enough money to live on, in which case you wouldn't need to have a TA/RA position, and the department would give it to someone else who otherwise wouldn't be funded. Or it's just extra money to line your pockets with. Either way, I'd go for it. "
6139,Is an iPad (or similar device) worth what it’ll cost as a PhD student?,Whait and save for the MacBook Pro. It is the only option that won’t leave you with regrets 
6140,International Grad to the US,
6141,Full time job vs Graduate Assistantship,"I don't know where you live, but with $10.42 an hr for 25hrs a week of work you could definitely make it work w/ having roommates. Also I'm under the impression that assistant ships pay for health insurance, but it depends on school.

Perhaps you should shoot an email to one of the students you met that are on assistantships and figure out how much they are able to survive on such pay and health insurance?

Depending on your state, you could be eligible for Medicaid and EBT. 

A lot of this *really* depends on more specific information about your school/program that you need to figure out if you haven't already. "
6142,How much did you have saved for grad school?,"Honestly, I only had about 2K saved when I started. I knew I'd have an RA position, so tuition was covered, but the stipend was almost nothing (I think it was like 2K per semester or something). I took about 25k of loans for my first year of school, and then I got one of the university's research fellowships for my final four years that included a live-able stipend. Those four years were tight, money-wise, but I didn't need additional loans. I actually ended up only using three years of the fellowship, and then I got a full-time job outside the university during my dissertation writing phase. I had also gotten married while in grad school, so between the income for my full-time job and my husband's income, we paid off my school loans in something like 9 months. 

Anyway, I guess loans aren't ideal, and I'd definitely advise everyone to think really carefully and realistically about them before deciding, but I think it worked out fine for me. For a variety of reasons (some of them to do with the economy, some of them to do with me making me naive decisions), the only job I could get between 2011 and when I started grad school in 2014 was as a barista at Starbucks. Even though I was living with my parents and didn't pay for rent *or* groceries (I know, I know), it would have taken me years to save up the 10-15k you have. I can't even imagine (don't want to) what my life would be like if I had waited three more years to start grad school, but I definitely do NOT regret starting with so little saved. But, as with any personal experience, YMMV. :) "
6143,Anyone else struggle with being waitlisted for funding?,
6144,How much does an out of state Master's program usually cost? How much financial aid is likely? What percentage of students are right out of college?,"I think the pricing varies widely. For my program, more than half of the students have TA or GA jobs that pay their tuition though, and I assume the rest of them have government loans like me. In my program, there are maybe a few who are right out of college? Maybe like 10%? Again, this all varies depending on the type of program and everything. "
6145,How to pay for grad school?,"My program (neuro) had a stipend and also tuition is waived. You've been accepted to this program but are not sure if theres support? Did they not mention it in an interview or online? I find that very unusual unless your program does not provide support which can happen but is more uncommon in stem which are often funded programs. Either way you should be weighing your options *before* you accept any offer.

Edit: is this a masters program? Because then yeah, forget what I said you wont have a stipend or waived tuition that only applies for PhD. "
6146,How long does it take to receive a funding letter?,"There's no one answer to this. Highly variable by school & department. You should just ask them, especially if it is affecting your decision making calculus. "
6147,What is your favorite search tool for scholarships/grants/fellowships?,"It's difficult to find scholarships for Master's level stuff. The only advice I can give is I once signed up for ScholarshipPoints just to check it out and then decided to delete the account since it seemed like a waste of time, and I got a barrage of bizarre spam emails after I sent in the request to delete the account. "
6148,How much in fees aren’t covered by tuition waivers?,"1100 a semester ( 3x a year) not including the $50 (a semester) parking pass for a parking lot a mile from my building. 

I cant wait to graduate. "
6149,Funding for masters degree,"Everyone I've known  continues with the intention of a PhD and then ""masters out"" once they've reached the point where they have a master's degree. This secures financial support / funding instead of having to worry about paying for a master's degree. "
6150,Grad school under reporting costs by $8k+,"Contact your financial aid office to see if they have a worksheet/form for additional or updated costs of attendance. This is fairly common so any finaid office should have one - I've had to do it for things like school-related travel and a special computer needed for my work. The form also contained lines for thing like program-specific fees and expenses for mandatory internships.

Regarding summer, you CAN take Stafford loans (if you're not already at your annual maximum) and gradPLUS for summer semesters, your school just needs to certify your enrollment for the summer and make the request. If someone in your finaid office tells you that isn't possible, talk to someone else until you find someone that knows how to do this. But it CAN be done.

A lot of financial aid offices are a combination of some very junior people who only recently started working there and a few very senior people who know all the ins and outs. You need to find and talk to one of the more senior people so they can tell you how to do all the things a more junior person might try to tell you aren't possible. "
6151,"Folks who started working after undergrad and went back to grad school, how did you make it work going from making middle class salary to $20k/yr stipend?","Hey, got accepted to a PhD w/ $26,300 stipend after having worked in the field for 5 yrs. I'm starting in the fall so I may not be the best person for advice, but I come from a similiar background with no financial safety net. Once I knew I was getting in, I rolled back my retirement contributions and started saving significantly. I also took stock of all recurring charges (subscriptions and such). I cancelled the unnecessary ones, looked for student rates for the ones I wanted to keep, and I plan to call and see if I can get a better deal for everything else. Luckily, I do live with my girlfriend, so that cuts down on shared costs a bit. I've had a recurring budget spreadsheet going for a few years now, so I just worked out reductions across the board where I could. Nothing that put me in a tough situation, though. Just eating in more than I like to. 

In actuality, I realized that after taxes, I'm going to be making more a year from this base stipend than I made at my first job out of college in my field (Psych Degree, Behavioral Pharmacology Research at John's Hopkins, $29,500), so it's not really that bad. I'm lucky in that almost all of my remaining student loans are subsidized and federal, so after I factor in not paying those every month (and not worrying about interest), not paying for benefits, and the additional tax breaks I get, the money that I get to put in my pocket isn't going to be that much less than what I make now doing research ($48,500 before taxes). Of course, my benefits are going to be way worse, but ya take what you can get. "

6153,How did you go about applying for student loans and what's a good interest rate?,Are you an American? If so you can still apply for FSA if attending an institution recognized by the federal government which I believe most reputable Euro places are.

6155,Applying for a MS while married and with a 7 months old boy,"Getting my DrPH at night, working a full time job as a director with 15 reports. I have a 3yr old and another on the way. My wife also works 

It's about time management and discipline. My work and school are seemlessly integrated. It's a lot of work. I pick 2 nights during the week to work and on Saturday and Sunday when my kiddo naps. 2 classes per term x 4 terms + 3 weeks a year on site. 4 yr doctorate program.

It's not easy, it shouldn't be. But that's how you know it's the right program. If you love what your focused on, you pull the work to yourself. Plan out the schedule with your spouse. "
6156,SUNY Students - Huge Dilemma IS Tuition,
6157,My stipend just got cut by 7K and I don't know what to do...,My stipend is 15k. I teach at the community college to bolster the income. At 19k you are getting a larger stipend than most folks I know across the country. 
6158,College ring in grad school,"I know some ring companies will do year changes for free. What if you send in the same ring you already have been wearing and get your new graduation year on it? I don’t know whether that is too far out or if the original design of your ring is still available (mine has been discontinued), but if that appeals to you, ask! I know some also sell other crazy expensive jewelry for those who don’t want a ring. 

I wore my undergrad ring for many years until someone from there became notorious and I felt too squicked out to even look at it. You can bet I’m getting a ring from my grad school, but I like rings and like wearing several. 

As other people have mentioned, maybe a special purchase would be a better commemoration. Get a super nice diploma frame or purchase the regalia. Or take yourself on a fabulous vacation if you can swing it. Heck, some people get tattoos. "

6161,How much do you budget per month for food?,"$500-$700 is absolutely insane for even 2 people. 

OP, figure out how much you can afford and then budget from there. You can easily eat well for around $150 per month. My husband and I did great on a $150 monthly budget. We got a chest freezer and took advantage of sales. Now that we aren’t budgeting, we average $350 per month for both of us. 

If you need to cut it really tight, check out r/32dollars. It’s a reddit page dedicated to people who eat on 32 dollars a week and enjoy it! I shopped like this for several months and was able to eat just about whatever I wanted thanks to aldi and sales. "

6163,Being taxed on tuition waiver,"This happened to me in grad school. I was a grad assistant and the law hit halfway through my program. I had been making ~900/mo plus room and board, and then the taxes hit and for three months I made ~200/mo. It was absolutely insane. "
6164,Do grad schools disburse tuition grants evenly each semester?,"I would ask your department administrator first. Every school does it differently, or it could be that you were awarded an additional recruitment grant or some smaller one-semester grant from the department. Since I had visited the campus/dept. prior to applying, they gave me a ""Recruitment"" scholarship my first semester, but it took some time to go through so it didn't show up on my account until late September/early October (I think they had some ""recruitment"" money left in their budget and distributed it among any of the new students who had visited the previous year rather than letting it get subsumed by the university/grad school). "
6165,Are there any resources to help afford purchasing a new laptop?,"A credit card goes a long way if they don’t already have one. In the long run it could be easier financially to buy a nicer laptop and pay like $75 a month than to drop a few hundred at once on a used one. Plus a new card usually won’t charge interest for 6 months. 

I did that when I had an emergency car repair for $800 (more than I make in a month) and it saved my life. "
6166,Question about how in-school deferment actually works,"At my school, you need to handle the deferment once at the beginning. But if you graduate in any way and then continue (example: if you get a masters then go on to PhD) you need to fill out the paperwork again. It’s not difficult by any means. But if you don’t take summer courses between the masters graduation and the fall courses for your PhD then those summer months will count towards your six month grace period. "
6167,Are assistantships taxed the same as a normal salary/wage?,"Maybe like 17-20% of your check is taxed and you have to file it at the end of the year.  Make sure you claim the right number is dependents.  ( More dependents=more tax withdrawn, but you may owe taxes at the end of the year.  And, oh yeah, it doesn't go towards your state residency either.  I moved back to my old state and they said you have to work for six months before paying in state tuition, except it can't be at the University.  Bleh. "
6168,Can I ask an employer to give me a salary instead of a tuition waiver? (probably a stupid question),Depends on the institution.

6170,Living on PhD stipend?,This is even worse when you’re international. No chance for part-time jobs in the US for F1 students 
6171,Jobs that pay for your masters???,"The information I have is similar to what was mentioned earlier. I know full time working professionals, who got their whole tuition paid for by their company. The companies just asked them to go to the nearest university.  When I was in undergrad, I knew TA grad students got stipend pay as well as most of their masters paid for. Just do your research on different companies. Many have school funding options. "

6173,"Complications related to grad school in a new state. I’m a student, fiancé isn’t. Can we both retain residency in old state? Does he have to legally move to new state? What did you guys do?","I’m a native Hoosier, and I did my undergrad at Purdue (Boiler Up). I can’t really help you on the legal issue side, but let me know if you have any questions about Purdue or Indiana. (I am also surprised that state taxes are higher than PA...) You may try asking this in /r/Purdue as well. "

6175,Fellowship only covers In-State Resident Tuition; is this the norm?,"UCs will generally cover the out of state resident tuition costs for the first year while helping non-resident students apply for residency during that first year. Once residency is established for that second year, the UC then covers the resident tutition. "
6176,One of my labmates told me that she owes over 170K in student loans,"I really don’t understand why people go so far into debt just to attend a private college. It just ruins your life forever.

6177,"Is a $12,000/year stipend for PhD reasonable?","PhD students paid $30k/year?! On top of tuition and fees?! In my current (Canadian) master's program PhD students get tuition & fees covered and a TAship position which pays about $6k a semester (for two semesters of teaching/marking duties, so \~$12/year). If you want more than that, you have to work extra (people take on tutoring, etc) or apply for scholarships. I thought that was generous; I am currently applying to PhD programs, and  would be ecstatic to get an acceptance offer which included tuition plus enough money to cover rent, utilities, and groceries. What else do you expect them to pay for? "
6178,Is Graduate school free?,[deleted] 
6179,Can you qualify for SSHRC or CIHR writing a Major Research Paper?,Yes. 
6180,Applied for a competitive graduate assistant position... did not get it,"Sorry to hear it, always a bummer :\\ Just from a purely tough love perspective though, best to take it in stride as a part of the ""getting used to it"" process - what doesn't kill you makes you stronger - because it's just the first of many rejections of many kinds you will get throughout your academic career (as is the case with everyone). "

6182,Supporting two people on a grad student stipend: Does our budget seem reasonable?,"This may seem trivial because it's one of your smaller expenses, but have you considered using the school gym/weight-room? Memberships for a university's gym and athletic centers are usually free for students, so try to take advantage of that while you still can! Even if your college doesn't automatically give you access to their gym they should give you the option of purchasing a very discounted membership.   


Like I said, it may be one of your smaller expenses but it could be a good way to save $45 a month! "
6183,The NDSEG Fellowship decisions have been sent out,Same boat. I thought I had a strong application and a shit ton of data to show for it. I will have to wait and see what the comments were. Was pretty disappointing but I kind of expected it. The NDSEG shows a HEAVY bias for awarding students from Ivy league Universities so I knew I was fighting an uphill battle even when I submitted. 
6184,Housing,"I lived in a ghetto apartment that did the same thing to me. They charged me a cleaning fee and I asked the office staff if they were going to replace the carpet if I paid the fee and she said no, then I get a bill in the mail for $300 to replace the carpet. I didn't pay it because I do not owe it.

When you move in, you will be given a form to fill out in which you are to document the condition of the apartment when you move in. I would go over every inch of that apartment in explicit detail and note every crack, scratch, wear mark, stain, discoloration, and anything that is not otherwise pristine and perfect. You might need additional paper, because the form they give you does not often include enough space. If you have to send it back to them in physical form, go to the post office closest to you and send a certified letter. This will require someone to sign for it and you will get a receipt, so they cannot claim they never received it because you have a receipt showing that the Post Office delivered it to their mailing address, and someone signed for it.

While you are doing this, take pictures of everything and then send them to yourself. Save them in a dropbox folder or something so there is at least one backup location.

As far as what happens when equipment is not repaired, put in work orders and call the office. You'll need to check your local laws, because in some places, residents can pay for a third party to perform services and then bill the landlord. I had a roach infestation in my apartment because the next door neighbors were hoarders, but the landlord took forever to send an extermination team out there. It was only after I threatened to call an exterminator myself and then deduct the cost from my rent that they sent someone out immediately. Work orders and follow up emails are a paper trail, so if they fail to repair things that could impact the living conditions of the apartment (i.e. heat is out for an extended period of time in winter) then that would help you in the long run. If you're worried about dirtying the carpet, you can buy plastic placemats or rugs on amazon for relatively cheap. Because of my experience, I'll never live in an apartment with carpet again.

Your landlord also just can't refuse to return the deposit. They must notify you regarding the reason they are withholding your deposit. If the reasoning is not justified, or you have evidence to the contrary, you can probably sue them in small claims court, but this can be a long process and you should make sure the evidence is in your favor before pursuing this route.

You should also not be afraid to discuss problems you're having with professors you become close to, because they might know something or know someone to talk to. That's how I found out about a tenant resource center in my town.

6185,Is anyone else working a part time job while in grad school?,"I work and go to school full time. I get all my assignments done and even manage time to go to the gym. Yes this means early mornings (6am) and late nights(11pm). 

I have a set schedule during my semesters and helps me stay on track! TBH, i have been doing this as an undergraduate as well and works best for me! "
6186,I’m not sure what to do,"Are you putting the financial aid towards tuition? In my school they put in “expected financial aid” on the account so one would only need to pay the balance even if the aid is not applied yet. However, you should just ask the school if sending your transcript in September causes issues with the aid. "
6187,"Off topic, but does anyone have any cool interior decorating resources for an apartment","My go-tos for cheap grad school furniture are Craigslist and Freecycle, and I also look at thrift stores and used furniture stores. I prefer furniture that looks comfortable to looking expensive. I also shop IKEA, and they do ship if you can’t go to a store. I’ve also found that my taste in tables that I can work at, better matches sturdier functional older stuff that you can only find used, than new stuff which tends to be flimsy and ornamental. "
6188,Plus loans to supplement stipend,Is there a reason you can't take a Stafford loan? Because that's a better bet for several reasons. Something like a $5000 loan paid back over ten years isn't going to kill you. 
6189,I enjoyed grad school but looking back I don’t know if it was a good return in investment. How to get over the regret,"I mean, maybe this isn't all that helpful, but what good is that regret doing you?

At best, regret helps you avoid similar mistakes. Maybe the program you chose wasn't a good idea in hindsight. You made a decision with the information you had, and maybe there were things you failed to consider. You're more mindful now about large financial decisions, maybe. So point taken, now what? So what does agonizing get you? You can't take it back. 

Just accept the past. I know it's easier said than done, but maybe you just need to let go. Savor the positives (your friends, experiences, etc), and think of the future. You can't change it, you've learned from it, and so the regret has served its purpose and is now overstaying its welcome. "

6192,Budgeting,"So I'm at grad school in DC, so my answer will be different than yours, but I figure it could give you a good idea. I get a stipend of $25k for the 9 months, and then I get stipend(s) during the summer that try to match what I make usually in a month. This past year I made around ~33k in stipends. For federal taxes I paid around ~$2.5k, and for DC I'd say it was around $1.5k. For the DC taxes I had some relief because there's a little thing about rent you pay during the year and how much you make (if your tax filing unit makes under ~$50k a year etc etc). So I don't know exactly what you'll have to be being in a different state and all, but for reference you can see it as ""another grad student in DC is making ~$30k in stipends, pays $3-4k in taxes"".

6197,Car insurance?,Wouldn't rates depend on the city you're in and your personal driving situation/? 
6198,Funding in foreign countries,"ti rispondo in italiano

se vuoi fare il dottorato in USA ti consiglio caldamente di fare anche la magistrale in italia, per 2 motivi:

- i colleghi americani fanno 4 anni di undergrad mentre noi solo 3 anni, e la maggior parte dei programmi richiedono 4 anni di studi universitari

- devi avere esperienza nella ricerca: noi purtroppo facciamo solo la tesi, che dura 1-3 mesi per la triennale, mentre i colleghi americani cominciano fin da subito a fare ricerca (i cosiddetti REU) e una volta laureati hanno già 4 anni di esperienza; facendo la magistrale guadagni altri 6-9 mesi di ricerca per la tesi magistrale (meglio ancora se riesci a pubblicarla)

una volta che hai queste cose in saccoccia puoi cominciare a cercare le università che ti interessano, vai nei siti dei vari dipartimenti di fisica e vedi se ci sono prof che fanno ricerca che ti piace... ogni università ha il suo sistema di application ma le cose comuni a tutti sono:

- TOEFL in quanto straniero

- transcript della tua carriera universitaria (un documento in cui ci sono i voti in tutte le materie e i tuoi titoli, tradotto in inglese)

- almeno 3 lettere di raccomandazione, scritte da tuoi professori/relatori/tutor ecc, ovvero gente che può testimoniare le tue capacità di studio, ricerca e insegnamento

- statement of purpose (la famosa ""lettera di presentazione"") in cui dici chi sei, che esperienza hai, perchè hai scelto quell'università ecc ecc

- la succitata research experience: oltre ai periodi di tesi, cerca di fare tirocini/volontariato in laboratori quanto più possibile

- alcune università ti chiedono il GRE, un test standardizzato del cazzo che costa un fottio, io personalmente non l'ho fatto, se puoi trova anche tu posti che non lo chiedono

considera che il metodo di selezione è molto diverso da quello italiano, non c'è un punteggio che ti viene assegnato, ma è piu un sistema ""olistico"", come dicono loro, guardano all'insieme: per esempio se hai voti bassi ma piu esperienza, sei avvantaggiato rispetto al secchione che ha la media altissima ma non è mai entrato in un laboratorio... diciamo che loro vanno più a ""fit"", devi saperti vendere

per quanto riguarda i fondi, solitamente il primo anno sei pagato dall'università per fare il teaching assistant, ovvero insegni un laboratorio o un corso a studenti piu piccoli, dal secondo anno in poi invece sei pagato dal gruppo di ricerca che scegli, il che ha i suoi pro (non c'e un contratto nazionale del cazzo come in italia, se meriti di piu ti danno piu: se il tuo tutor vince tanti fondi, ti aumento lo stipendio) ma anche contro (se il tuo tutor perde i fondi resti anche tu con le pezze ar culo)

e poi boh, se ti servono altre informazioni puoi contattarmi in privato

edit: dimenticavo, in USA a differenza dell'italia devi anche seguire lezioni, al primo anno, che di solito sono ripetizione di quelle che farai alla magistrale "

My suggestion: get as much RAM as you can, aim for mid to mid high processor, definitely go for an SSD, see if you can get a good GPU (which are becoming great tools for ML). With $1500 you should be able to get check all or nearly all of those boxes. "

6209,MSF Programs... FSU & USF. Need help differentiating,"I'm not a finance person, but general stuff to consider:

First, having spent some time in both Tallahassee and Tampa (as a resident or longer-term visitor to people who lived there) Tampa is way more sprawl-y with lots more traffic and more areas that are, say, strictly commercial. I'd do a little research on the Tampa area to make sure you're comfortable with the commute times, areas within your price range in relation to distance from school, etc. Tallahassee is pretty quick and easy to get around, not to mention fairly inexpensive, where Tampa may not be depending on where you live in relation to USF.

Second, are either offering funding? If so, how much? How is tuition in comparison? Less debt is often better.

Third, and probably most important (especially if you're expecting to take on significant debt) is: how's the job placement after school? If the placement rates are about the same into similar-prestige positions, than the cheaper option is probably better. If one costs more but results in better jobs/jobs more to your taste/jobs that pay better, than that needs to be taken heavily into consideration. You can often find statistics on this on websites or by (tactfully) asking for statistics from department administrators. "

6219,Advice on finding scholarships?,"The vast majority (probably 95+%) are going to be administered by the individual university, school/department, or research group. That's just the way it is. Juggling all of the completely-separate applications means that you'll have to limit yourself only to the programs you're very serious about and would definitely accept if offered to you. It takes months to create your application materials in a lot of cases, so you can't make a good application to a lot of places all at once. 

I think once you go above 10 then you're definitely looking at some poor quality or rushed submissions, but it's even a lot of work above 5.

6228,Is going for a Doctorate Financially Worth It?,"Congrats on your acceptance.

I don't know what the norm for Musicology is, but I would not do a PhD that wasn't fully funded for at least 5 years.  I would personally feel uncomfortable with six figures of debt and a PhD, which may or may not pay a salary that would allow me to pay off the debt easily.  I would think long and hard what your career goal is and if the PhD is needed for that.

There are a few things I thought about before going back to for my PhD: earning potential, debt, and retirement.  I'm in a very different field, but overall, while you're doing a PhD, that's at least half a decade of lost earning potential that you could have gotten with a full-time job.  Also, during those years, you will not be able to contribute to an employer matched retirement fund, and may or may not be able to contribute to an IRA.  And, you are debt-free right now, so you don't need to worry about interest piling up on existing student loans while they're in deferment.

Ultimately, it's up to you whether this debt load is worth it for the intellectual challenge and possibly a college-level teaching gig. "
6229,Opinion on living situation/budget for grad students,"I make a bit less than you do monthly ($1900 or so after taxes) and pay probably $800ish per month on rent and utilities—over 40% of my takehome pay. I live with roommates and have a short (15-20 minutes) public transportation commute in the morning. As somebody who has done three hours a day on public transportation to get to class before... absolutely do not do that if you can avoid it. It is super draining, and in grad school, time is your most important resource. The 30% rule is meant to be a benchmark of sorts and doesn’t really work for all situations (particularly city living). I would also maybe put off saving for retirement at the level you planned here if you can swing it. I don’t get any retirement benefits from the university like matched contributions but I try to throw a few hundred dollars a year into my Roth IRA. It’s not a ton but it’s more than nothing, and it’s really all I can swing at this point. I know I’ll have to be more aggressive about saving later in life but the point of what I’m doing now is to prepare me for my future career in which I’ll have a higher earning potential.  "
6230,Does this type of living arrangement exist?,"You could also look into private rooms in a youth hostel, if that's something your university town has. Most hostels have some private rooms \(often with their own bathroom\), and on a Monday night, the hostel as a whole is unlikely to be crowded/noisy, so you'll probably have good access to the kitchen and stuff. This would be more of a ""budget"" option than what it seems like you're looking for, but I'm just chucking it out there. :\) "
6231,Should I take a break after graduating with my B.S. and how should I optimize my break time if I do?,"You don't sound ignorant - it's a good thing that you're thinking about these things now. I got my B.A. last year and took this past year off because I felt burned out and needed a break. I also didn't want to pile on grad app stress onto my senior year, so that's another benefit to taking a gap year to consider. 

Academically, you sound like you would be a solid candidate, so I don't think taking a year off would hurt your application. If anything, I think taking a year off, in giving you some more time to work on your applications, might be helpful (especially in giving you time to study for the GRE). It's also good to go in with a plan for how to continue building on your relevant experience in that year. For me, that meant taking on a job building from my tutoring/teaching experience, and presenting at a conference, which wasn't a lot, but both were good outlets for me to do what I'm passionate about. 

Financially, I'm very glad I took a year off to have a chance to save money for a future move and grad app fees - though you should definitely look into fee waivers for your application fees and GRE. When it comes to school visits, I would echo what another commenter mentioned - there's a good chance that there will be a Welcome Weekend type event for a program you get into, and they usually cover plane fare, etc. 

When it comes to saving (and I didn't quite realize this in the past year), there are some things you may want to keep in mind for a potential move. This depends on where you end up, so some of these things may not apply for you (I'm moving across the country for my program): 

* security deposit for an apartment 
* plane ticket/traveling costs 
* a decent suitcase 
* shipping costs 
* first month's rent/expenses 

I've been able to save for most of these things, and I'm thankfully not worried about my first month thanks to my parents agreeing to give me a small loan, but I know a friend in my cohort is struggling with moving expenses. 

Sorry for the length, but I hope this helps - good luck on your senior year!  "
6232,Is it typical to not know how you’re funded/where the research funds come from?,"I know now which grant I am paid from because I have to fill in the ""hours worked"" time sheet, which only happens with one of our possible grants. For the first 3 years I had no idea. The same with most other people in my group. I order supplies for the whole group and still usually don't know the account number \- the department secretary picks it when processing the order. My advisor says it isn't something we need to worry about \(and it seems we never got into a serious money trouble, so fine\). Yes, if you have a reason to know, ask the administration, or ask your advisor. "
6233,Question regarding graduate assistantship eligibility,"In the US, I've heard of national fellowship ineligibility based on having a previous masters, but I've never heard of GA ineligibility.  Many of my colleagues had one or two masters in same and/or other fields before becoming GAs in a PhD program.  It was up to the PI, though. "
6234,Should I stick with the Student Health Insurance or sign up for an individual health insurance plan?,$1970 is low as hell for a annual plan. My school's is over $3000 per year. 
6235,Struggling with funding and financial planning.,"Ive been reading the pfforphds.com blog for a few months, it’s been very helpful for planning financial goals during grad school.  "
6236,"Grad School, good gpa, good portfolio, but a low Credit Score","Hmm, this may be a better question for r/personalfinance "
6237,Get paid to edit papers?,Are you in grad school now? My university library has writing tutors who are mostly grad students. You can check to see if your school has something similar. 
6238,Grad School Fellowship Questions,"Unless you want to stay in your current lab for your PhD, you won't be competitive. I've certainly heard of students advancing to PhD from same masters program. You won't score well if your application can't demonstrate that your facilities are great (like you need to give details of square footage of bench space), your PI has funding with the ability to graduate students, your research plan is feasible and novel, and your training plan has an endpoint with writing/teaching/research goals.

Edit: Also they do ask about how far along in the program you are and everything. I just don't think it'll be worth it to try at this point. Maybe small scholarships, but not a fellowship for a future PhD. It'll probably end up not discussed. "
6239,Question about funds for thesis project? (Canadian),Funding varies by school and department. It wouldn’t hurt to ask your supervisor.
